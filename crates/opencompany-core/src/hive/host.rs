//! This company as the host of one completion episode.
//!
//! `tinyhivemind` owns the episode -- who runs next, what a committed row
//! means, the conversations a seat opens, the nudges, the walls, the
//! completion fold, parking on an approval, and the checkpoint a restart
//! resumes from. It owns no storage and names no type of this host, so it
//! asks for two things:
//!
//! - a **journal** ([`Journal`]): this company's event log to read a seat's
//!   rows from, and somewhere to append what the episode commits;
//! - a **host** ([`EpisodeHost`]): how this company builds one teammate as a
//!   seat, with the episode's tools on its belt.
//!
//! The seat is a **session host**, not an `AgentSpec`. A spec names its
//! tools from the runtime's registry, fixed when the agent is built; an
//! episode's tools are bound to one seat of one episode and drain into that
//! episode's record. Inheritance is the point of the hosted runner: the belt
//! is this company's belt plus the episode's, and the gate is the episode's
//! admission in front of this company's own `ApprovalPolicy`, so a call the
//! episode does not serve still reaches that policy and can still park.
