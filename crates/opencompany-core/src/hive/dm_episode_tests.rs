//! **An operator DM, driven end to end.**
//!
//! Everything else about DMs is asserted a decision at a time: the hive is
//! built right, the chat resolves to a room, the owner answers rather than a
//! ranker. None of that proves the parts meet. This drives the real path --
//! real `dm_hives`, real `surface_of`, real dispatcher, real `conducted::run`,
//! real `HostedRunner`, real seats on the pool's own agents -- and stubs one
//! thing, at the one boundary that would need a credential: the model's
//! choices, via a scripted OpenAI-compatible endpoint on loopback.
//!
//! That is the shape `gated_tool_turn_tests` established, reused here because
//! an episode is exactly the kind of wiring a unit test stays green through.
