//! Jev routing over the TinyHumans System One proxy.
//!
//! A desk episode asks Jev — TypeSafe's System One model — who should speak
//! next: which seats a message needs, whether a broadcast fans out, whether the
//! question is too ambiguous to route at all. `tinyhivemind_typesafe::JevRouter`
//! owns that conversation; it deliberately owns **no HTTP client, credential
//! or runtime**, and asks the host for exactly one thing — a
//! [`SystemOneTransport`] that can put a [`SystemOneRequest`] on the wire and
//! bring a [`SystemOneResponse`] back. This module is that thing.
//!
//! The wire goes to **TinyHumans**, not to TypeSafe directly. The
//! `/agent-integrations/openrouter/systemone` route on the TinyHumans API is a
//! System One proxy: same request body, same response body, but authenticated
//! with the TinyHumans key every hosted and desktop instance already has, so a
//! company needs no second credential to route. The proxy resolves the
//! `jev-latest` alias to a concrete `typesafe/jev-*` id and reports that id in
//! the response's `model`; the router records it and never compares it to the
//! request's, so the alias is safe to keep asking for.
//!
//! Three rules, each the reason for a line below:
//!
//! * **No key, no router.** [`jev_router`] answers `None` when no TinyHumans
//!   credential resolves, and the caller routes by desk lead and explicit
//!   mention instead (`docs/spec/runtime/hive.md`). A router that would fail
//!   every call is worse than none: every episode would pay a timeout before
//!   falling back.
//! * **The key resolves the way every other managed call's key does** —
//!   `OPENCOMPANY_INFERENCE_KEY`, then the TinyHumans token tiers (projected
//!   file over static `TINYHUMANS_API_KEY`) — through the same
//!   [`Credential`] seam the harness provider uses, so a rotated token file is
//!   picked up per request and a 401 invalidates the cached read.
//! * **The URL is the operator's to move, not to downgrade.**
//!   `OPENCOMPANY_JEV_URL` points a staging box at its own proxy; it must be
//!   `https`, or `http` to a loopback host, for the same reason the analytics
//!   collector has that rule: the credential is a request header on every
//!   call, and a plain-`http` endpoint on a container network would put it on
//!   the wire in the clear.
//!
//! One retry, then the caller's fallback. A `429`/`529` (TypeSafe's documented
//! transient statuses, `classify_retry`) or any `5xx` from the proxy in front
//! gets exactly one immediate second attempt; anything else — a `4xx`, a
//! timeout, a connection refused — is returned at once as
//! [`Error::Transport`] and the driver routes the round without Jev. Routing
//! is on the critical path of every desk round, so a long backoff here would
//! be a long silence in the room.
