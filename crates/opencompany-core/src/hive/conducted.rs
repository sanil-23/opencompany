//! message opens, seats each teammate as a session host of its own, and
//! calls [`run_episode`]. Everything between -- who speaks next, what a
//! committed row means, the private conversations a seat opens, the nudges,
//! the walls, the completion fold, parking on an approval, and the
//! checkpoint a restart resumes from -- belongs to the library.
//!
//! What stays here is what the library cannot know: the journal rows are
//! this company's, the seats are its teammates, and a turn still takes the
//! teammate's lock and writes its brackets. Those reach the loop through
//! [`DeskHost`].
