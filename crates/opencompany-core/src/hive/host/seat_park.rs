//! What one seat turn claims, what it leaves waiting on the operator, and how
//! the operator's decision reaches the seat again.
//!
//! A seat turn runs on the episode's own task, outside every chat cycle, so it
//! takes its own claims: an approval bucket keyed by its episode-seat turn key,
//! the explicit-request guard, a publish claim and an output claim. `after_turn`
//! drains the approval bucket and parks it through the runtime's shared
//! [`ApprovalParker`], under that same turn key, so the resolve path can find
//! its way back to this episode. `park_seat` files what the turn published on
//! a card minted for the room, and hands the outputs it produced, along with
//! that card, to `delivery` to ride the seat's next row on the desk.
