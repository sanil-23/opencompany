//! Recovering a tool call a native-tool-calling model wrote as prose.
//!
//! # The leak
//!
//! On the native transport the harness sends `tools` in the request and reads
//! `message.tool_calls` back. A model that honours that contract is the
//! reliable path and nothing here runs. A model that *sometimes* honours it is
//! the problem this module exists for: the same agent, in the same thread, one
//! turn apart, was observed executing `read_ledger` correctly and then writing
//!
//! ```text
//! function_call:{"id":"call_3rY…","call":"read_ledger",
//!                "arguments":{"ledger":"tasks","query":"2026-09-01"}}
//! ```
//!
//! into the message body instead. The tool never ran, the sentence the model
//! had already written ("I'll check the tasks ledger…") became a promise it
//! could not keep, and the operator saw raw JSON in company chat.
//!
//! # Why this is in the provider, and not in a dispatcher
//!
//! OpenHuman has a `ToolDispatcher` seam with a text-parsing fallback, and
//! [`AttrTolerantXmlDispatcher`](super::tool_dispatcher::AttrTolerantXmlDispatcher)
//! extends it for #105's attribute-form open tags. That seam is **not on this
//! turn path**. Since openhuman #4249 removed the legacy engine, every turn runs
//! through the tinyagents harness, and its loop takes a turn's tool calls from
//! exactly one place — `response.tool_calls()` on the structured
//! [`ModelResponse`](tinyinference::model::ModelResponse)
//! (`agent_loop/run_loop.rs`). It never parses model text. The injected
//! `ToolDispatcher` still renders the transcript and the prompt protocol, but
//! its `parse_response` is reached only by the end-of-turn wrap-up check.
//!
//! So the last point at which a text-shaped call can still become a real one is
//! where this crate turns the wire payload into a `ModelResponse`:
//! [`model_response_from_payload`](super::provider). That is where this is
//! called from, and it is why a fix at the dispatcher seam would have parsed
//! perfectly and executed nothing.
//!
//! # What the vendored text parser would not have caught anyway
//!
//! Two independent reasons, both of which the observed shape trips:
//!
//! * **The name key.** It resolves a call's name from `name` or
//!   `function.name`. `call` — what the model above used — is not a name key it
//!   knows, so the object parses as JSON and is then rejected as not a call.
//! * **The surrounding prose.** Its whole-response JSON path requires the
//!   *entire* trimmed response to be one JSON value. An object embedded in a
//!   sentence, or in a fenced block under a lead-in line, only survives when a
//!   recognised tag marks it — and here nothing does.
//!
//! Widening either of those in a shared parser is what its own comments refuse,
//! and correctly: `{"name":"Alice","input":"hi"}` is an ordinary model reply,
//! and a parser with no idea which tools exist cannot tell it from a call.
//!
//! # The tag dialects
//!
//! The leak has a second shape, and it is not JSON at all: a model writing its
//! call as **markup**, either Claude's `<invoke name="…"><parameter name="…">`
//! form or a vendor dialect that wraps those same tags in a marker glyph —
//! DeepSeek's is
//!
//! ```text
//! <｜｜DSML｜｜tool_calls>
//! <｜｜DSML｜｜invoke name="workspace_search">
//! <｜｜DSML｜｜parameter name="query" string="true">team</｜｜DSML｜｜parameter>
//! </｜｜DSML｜｜invoke>
//! </｜｜DSML｜｜tool_calls>
//! ```
//!
//! observed in company chat against a `chat-v1`-tier model. Neither shape has a
//! `{` in it, so the object scan below never sees a candidate and the whole
//! turn's tool calls are lost — the agent then narrates results it never
//! received.
//!
//! tinyagents *can* parse the undecorated form
//! (`tool_calling::parse::TOOL_CALL_OPEN_TAGS`), which is a large part of why
//! this gap read as covered. It is not: that parser is reachable only through
//! OpenHuman's `ToolDispatcher`, and this turn path never asks it anything (see
//! above). The decorated form it would miss regardless — its open-tag table
//! matches `<invoke` literally, and the marker sits between the `<` and the
//! keyword.
//!
//! So the scan here matches a tag keyword through an optional **decoration**:
//! the run between `<` and the keyword, which must be short, unbroken, and
//! carry at least one non-ASCII character. That last condition is what keeps
//! `<invoker>` and `<parameterise>` from matching — a dialect marks its markers,
//! and an ASCII run in that position is an ordinary tag name.
//!
//! # What licenses the widening here
//!
//! This runs where the turn's own tool schemas are in hand. A candidate is
//! recovered only when its resolved name **is a tool this turn offered the
//! model**, which is a far stronger marker than any key-shape heuristic — and
//! it is a marker a shared parser structurally cannot use. It also makes the
//! recovery inert by construction on a turn that suppressed tools. Every other
//! reject stays as strict as the vendored path:
//!
//! * an argument key must be present, or the object must carry nothing but the
//!   name (and an optional `id`/`type`), so prose *about* a tool cannot fire it;
//! * arguments must resolve to a JSON object, stringified or not;
//! * a turn that already produced structured calls is never touched — this does
//!   not compete with the native channel, it only catches what that channel
//!   dropped.
//!
//! # This is a host-level compensation, and should not outlive its cause
//!
//! The defect underneath is upstream, in tinyagents. `NativeDialect` already
//! carries a text fallback for exactly this case — empty structured calls, parse
//! the text instead — and nothing in tinyagents ever reaches it, because its
//! dialects are only callable through OpenHuman's `ToolDispatcher`. Inside
//! tinyagents that fallback is dead code, which is why a gap this plain stayed
//! invisible: it looks covered.
//!
//! The recovery below would sit more correctly in tinyagents' own loop, and the
//! usual objection does not apply there. A free parser cannot validate a name
//! against a belt it has no access to, but the loop can: `self.tools.schemas()`
//! and the `response.tool_calls()` read that gives up on the turn are the same
//! struct, a few hundred lines apart. Fixed there, every consumer of the runtime
//! gets it rather than this host alone.
//!
//! It is here because tinyagents is a submodule of a submodule: landing it
//! upstream is three sequenced pull requests and two pointer bumps, against a
//! runtime other products depend on, while companies are shipping broken turns
//! now. When the upstream fix lands, **delete this** — a compensation kept past
//! its cause is just a second implementation of the same rule, and the two will
//! disagree eventually. `refuse_approval_siblings` in
//! [`provider`](super::provider) is the part that stays either way: the approval
//! boundary is this crate's policy, not the runtime's.
//!
//! # Ids are synthesized, and that is load-bearing
//!
//! A recovered call has no provider id, and the agent loop pairs each tool
//! result back to its opener by id. Without one, the result answers no call:
//! the transcript's assistant opener and the tool message disagree, the cycle is
//! dropped on its way back to the wire, and the model never learns that its tool
//! ran or what it returned — so it re-narrates the same intention on the next
//! iteration. The tool still runs, and the operator is still billed for it. That
//! is the most misleading failure available here, and giving both halves the
//! same synthesized id is what avoids it.
