//! Task-aware extraction of an oversized tool result (issue #6014).
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! A tool result larger than the per-result budget used to be **cut on a byte
//! boundary**. That keeps the first few whole records and discards every one
//! after them, which is the wrong end to lose: a listing of thirty issues
//! became two, and the agent — correctly reporting what it could see — told the
//! operator there were two.
//!
//! Two cheaper transforms were tried first and are worth recording so nobody
//! re-derives them. **Dropping navigation fields**
//! ([`project_records_value`](crate::harness::composio_catalog::project_records_value))
//! measured **1.6x** on a real 237 KB GitHub payload — real, free, and nowhere
//! near enough. **Capping every long string** would have kept all thirty
//! records, but it clips the one body the operator asked about exactly as hard
//! as the twenty-nine they did not, because it has no idea which is which.
//!
//! The size is not the problem. The problem is that **nothing in the pipeline
//! knew what the turn was for**, so every strategy had to guess uniformly.
//!
//! # What it does instead
//!
//! [`PayloadSummarizer::maybe_summarize_in_parent`] is handed the tool name,
//! the raw payload **and the turn's task hint**, so the compression can keep
//! what answers the question and drop what does not. That trait has existed
//! upstream all along; OpenCompany simply never set it
//! (`AgentBuilder::payload_summarizer` defaults to `None`, and the only wiring
//! site is OpenHuman's own factory, which builds a **sub-agent** implementation
//! this crate cannot use — see `toolbelt`'s v1 note on why spawn tools are
//! withheld under multi-tenancy).
//!
//! So this is the same contract with a different engine: **one bounded,
//! tool-less model call**, the shape
//! [`TriageEvaluator`](crate::harness::triage), the card titler and
//! [`TaskPlanner`](crate::harness::planning) already use — built `from_deps`
//! so it shares the company's provider, its BYOK switch and its metering
//! rather than resolving a second credential path.
//!
//! # Failure is never fatal
//!
//! Every failure path returns [`SummarizeOutcome::Unavailable`], never `Err`:
//! a summarizer that times out must leave the turn holding the raw payload
//! (which downstream truncation still bounds), not kill the tool call. The
//! reason rides along so the model is told the result is unsummarized rather
//! than being handed a fragment silently.
