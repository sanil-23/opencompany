//! Issue #416 — the **confined turn**: an agent that reaches nothing but the
//! message it was given.
//!
//! ## What was wrong
//!
//! The per-workflow copilot (#303) sends its question to the company
//! orchestrator on a dedicated thread. The question is *grounded* — the console
//! inlines that workflow's graph and its recorded runs — and the exchange is
//! isolated in the journal. But the thread only ever selected the responder and
//! the journal thread; it did not narrow what the responder could reach. The
//! teammate answering held the whole company's context and its full tool
//! surface, so "answer only about this workflow" was a sentence in a prompt,
//! and a sentence is advice.
//!
//! ## What a confined turn is
//!
//! An ephemeral agent, built for one turn and dropped afterwards, whose reach is
//! the message and nothing else:
//!
//! * **No tools.** Its toolbelt is empty — not even the intrinsic memory tools
//!   every roster agent carries, and none of the orchestrator's `query_company`
//!   / `spawn_task` / `delegate_to_desk`. It cannot read the board, the roster,
//!   the workspace tree, another workflow, an MCP server, the web, or a file.
//! * **No company memory.** No memory tool is wired, and [`ConfinedContext`]
//!   — an in-process store that holds nothing and answers every read empty —
//!   is what any later memory seam must be pointed at, so the company
//!   [`ContextStore`] is not reachable through recall. The pool
//!   additionally skips the retrieve→inject step and the memory writeback for a
//!   confined turn, so no prior task outcome is prepended to the message and the
//!   exchange leaves nothing behind for a later turn to retrieve.
//! * **Enforced, not requested.** [`ConfinedToolPolicy`] denies **every** tool
//!   call by name whatever the belt holds. An empty belt already means the model
//!   is offered nothing; the policy is what makes that a boundary rather than an
//!   absence — a tool wired here by a later change, or a name the model invents,
//!   is refused by the host with a reason, not run.
//! * **No delegation.** The brain runs this turn directly rather than through
//!   the delegation runner, so a confined turn cannot hand off to a desk and
//!   have the desk do what it was not allowed to.
//!
//! ## What a copilot turn can still reach
//!
//! Exactly what the console put in the message: the workflow's name, id,
//! description, its nodes and edges, and the summaries of its own recorded runs.
//! Plus the operator's question, and the earlier turns of this same thread that
//! the provider carries. Nothing else — and when a question genuinely needs
//! company-wide context, the persona tells it to say so and point at the Chat
//! tab rather than answer from material it does not have.
//!
//! Compiled only under `feature = "openhuman"`, with the rest of the harness.
