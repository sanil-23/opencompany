/// **The regression.** The bug this issue closes: a top-level orchestrator

/// Before this issue's fix, `classify_turn` had no arm between the
/// wall-clock-ceiling check and the generic `Hard` catch-all, so this
/// exact scenario fell through to `Hard(OpenCompanyError::Harness(format!("turn

/// are ordered ceiling → budget → generic, and removing the budget arm
/// (i.e. reverting this diff) makes this body fall through to the generic
/// arm, which this test would then catch as an `Err` instead of the
