/// **The regression.** The bug this issue closes: a top-level orchestrator
/// turn whose own inference call fails with a budget-exhausted body — no
/// delegated-tool envelope marker anywhere in the chain, because nothing
/// was delegated — must terminate `Ok(TurnOutcome { budget_paused: Some(_), .. })`
/// and park a re-issue marker, NOT propagate `Err(OpenCompanyError::Harness(_))`.
///
/// Before this issue's fix, `classify_turn` had no arm between the
/// wall-clock-ceiling check and the generic `Hard` catch-all, so this
/// exact scenario fell through to `Hard(OpenCompanyError::Harness(format!("turn
/// for '{agent}': {err}")))` and `HarnessPool::run` returned that `Err` to
/// every caller — the silent mid-task break the issue is named for. This
/// test's premise is provable by inspection: `classify_turn`'s match arms
/// are ordered ceiling → budget → generic, and removing the budget arm
/// (i.e. reverting this diff) makes this body fall through to the generic
/// arm, which this test would then catch as an `Err` instead of the
/// expected `Ok`. The `ScriptedProvider` returns the error DIRECTLY from
/// `ChatModel::invoke` (no tool call, no delegation, no envelope) — the
/// "simple non-delegating task" the issue specifies.
