//! [`HarnessRunTurn`]: the harness's [`RunTurn`] implementation.
//!
//! Wraps a [`HarnessPool`] and the [`HarnessDeps`] every turn draws on, and
//! forwards each [`RunTurn`] method to the matching `pool.run*` call — the one
//! place [`HarnessDeps`] is re-attached to the brain-agnostic delegation seam
//! (issue #176). Both are borrowed, so the shared delegation queue and steer
//! registry inside `deps` stay the very handles the
//! [`DelegationRunner`](crate::runtime::delegation::DelegationRunner) drains.
//!
//! Compiled only under `feature = "openhuman"`.
