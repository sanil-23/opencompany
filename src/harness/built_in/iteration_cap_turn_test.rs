//! End-to-end proof of issue #988's two halves, driven by a *model*: the turn's
//! tool-iteration ceiling really is [`MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`], and a teammate who
//! has declared a `budget_usd_daily` gets an in-turn brake that halts a turn
//! outrunning it — while a teammate who has declared none gets no such brake at
//! all, matching openhuman's own opt-in `GoalBudgetStopHook` posture rather
//! than a blanket ceiling this crate would invent and own alone.
//!
//! Neither half can be shown by a unit test. The cap lives on the vendored
//! session's config and is only spent by the real tool loop, and
//! openhuman's `BudgetStopHook` fires from inside
//! openhuman's `tinyagents` middleware off usage the *provider* reported — so a
//! test that never makes a provider call never fires it. The offline
//! [`MockProvider`](crate::harness::provider::MockProvider) cannot stand in
//! either: it issues no tool calls at all, so a turn against it is one
//! iteration long by construction.
//!
//! So this drives the **real** harness — real [`build_agent`], real
//! [`CompanyAgent::run`], real [`HostedProvider`] (which advertises
//! `tool_calling: true`, putting the turn on the production
//! `NativeToolDispatcher` path), real [`ApprovalPolicy`] under the default
//! `supervised` mode, real sandboxed file tools — and stubs exactly one thing,
//! at the one boundary that needs a credential: the model's choices, via a
//! scripted OpenAI-compatible endpoint on loopback (the shape
//! [`workspace_turn_test`](super::workspace_turn_test) and
//! [`search_turn_test`](super::search_turn_test) established).
//!
//! The scripted model reads a different file each iteration. Distinct arguments
//! are load-bearing: openhuman's repeat-progress guard halts a run that reissues
//! an *identical* successful tool batch, so a loop of one repeated call would
//! stop for a reason that has nothing to do with the cap under test.
//!
//! The load-bearing assertions are the two a shorter test cannot make:
//!
//! * a turn that spends **more than the old ceiling of 10** iterations now
//!   delivers its answer instead of pausing at a checkpoint; and
//! * a budget halt and an iteration-cap pause are **different outcomes** —
//!   openhuman reports the latter through `Agent::last_turn_hit_cap`, which
//!   stays `false` for the former. Part 1 of #926 makes the cap pause
//!   operator-visible, so the two must never be conflated; and
//! * a teammate with **no declared `budget_usd_daily`** gets no in-turn brake
//!   at all — a turn that would have blown past any invented blanket figure
//!   still finishes, because there is no hook installed to stop it.
