//! Running a company's turn on an **ACP agent** instead of the embedded
//! OpenHuman harness.
//!
//! ## What this unlocks
//!
//! [`RunTurn`] is the seam between "the company cycle" and "an agent runs a
//! turn". It had exactly one implementation, `HarnessRunTurn`, which drives an
//! in-process OpenHuman agent and therefore needs an inference credential and
//! the whole vendored runtime. A second implementation over ACP serves three
//! things at once:
//!
//! - **A desktop company with no key.** The embedded host runs a turn on the
//!   operator's own `claude-code-acp`, against their existing subscription.
//!   Nothing to configure on first run, which is a materially different product
//!   from one that opens on a credential form.
//! - **Reverse dispatch.** A cloud host hands a task to a runner on someone's
//!   machine; the runner is an ACP agent as far as this is concerned.
//! - **Any other harness.** Codex, and anything else that speaks ACP.
//!
//! ## Why a port rather than an ACP client in here
//!
//! The transport differs per caller — a subprocess over stdio for the desktop,
//! a WebSocket for a runner — and neither belongs in the host crate. The port
//! itself ([`AcpAgent`], [`AcpAgentFactory`], `AcpTurn`, `AcpUpdate`) lives at
//! [`crate::ports::acp`], ungated, because the desktop shell that supplies the
//! stdio implementation deliberately does not enable the `openhuman` feature
//! this module lives behind — see that module's own docs for why. What
//! belongs here is [`AcpRunTurn`]: the adapter that folds whatever an
//! `AcpAgent` reports into this crate's own [`TurnStep`] shape, a genuine
//! `openhuman` dependency the port itself has none of.
//!
//! ## The mapping, and where it is lossy
//!
//! ACP's `session/update` variants and OpenCompany's [`TurnStep`] were designed
//! for different things, and the join is not total:
//!
//! | `sessionUpdate` | becomes |
//! |---|---|
//! | `agent_message_chunk` | appended to the reply |
//! | `agent_thought_chunk` | one coalesced `Thinking` step |
//! | `tool_call` | a `ToolCall` step, `Running` |
//! | `tool_call_update` | that step's status and result |
//! | `plan`, `available_commands_update`, … | dropped |
//!
//! Dropped rather than approximated: a `plan` is a task board, and inventing
//! `TurnStep`s for its entries would put rows on the operator's timeline that
//! no tool call produced.
