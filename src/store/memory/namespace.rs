//! Company-derived memory namespaces — the tenant-isolation invariant.
//!
//! The three memory ports take `&CompanyId` as an explicit first argument, and
//! that argument is a *compiler-enforced* isolation guarantee: a call site
//! cannot reach company B's facts while holding company A's id, because there is
//! nowhere to put the wrong value. [`MemoryProvider`] has no such argument. It
//! has `namespace: &str`, and a missing or wrong prefix is a silent cross-tenant
//! leak that nothing in the type system catches. That gets worse with a hosted
//! engine, where the namespace string is the only thing keeping tenants apart
//! inside somebody else's database.
//!
//! So this module reintroduces the guarantee the contract gives up.
//! [`Namespace`] is a newtype whose only constructors are `pub(super)`, wrapping
//! a string nothing outside [`crate::store::memory`] can produce, read, or
//! forge. Every namespace originates from
//! [`Namespace::company_root`], which takes a `&CompanyId` — so the *only* way
//! to name a namespace is to already hold the company whose namespace it is.
//!
//! [`MemoryProvider`]: tinymemory_api::provider::MemoryProvider
