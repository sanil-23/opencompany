//! One agent, opened: the detail read and the edit behind `GET`/`PATCH
//! {scope}/team/{agent_id}` (issue #264).
//!
//! Before this, an agent was a dead end. `GET …/team` returned a name, a role
//! and a description; nothing carried the agent's tier, its tool grants or its
//! desks, and there was no per-agent route at all. So the console could show a
//! card and offer to delete it, and that was the whole of what an operator
//! could learn or do. Worse than the missing screen: **checking what tools a
//! company actually grants an agent had no read surface anywhere**, which is
//! why a tool-grant change could not be verified from outside the process.
//!
//! ## Effective, not declared
//!
//! [`AgentToolsDto`] carries the three levels rather than one, because the
//! interesting number is the one nobody could see. `requested` is what the
//! `[[agent]].tools` line asks for, `companyAllow` is the `[tools].allow`
//! ceiling it is intersected with, and `effective` is what the agent actually
//! ends up holding. An agent that requests `workspace.read` under a company
//! that allows only `composio` requests one tool and holds none, and a surface
//! that printed the request alone would report the opposite of the truth.
//! A `deskCeilingActive` flag sits alongside the desk level so a reader can
//! tell "no desk narrows anything" from "a desk narrows everything away" —
//! the narrowed `deskAllow` list can be empty in both cases.
//!
//! `effective` is computed by
//! [`agent_effective_grants`](crate::runtime::builder::agent_effective_grants)
//! — the *same* function the harness calls when it builds the agent, not a
//! re-implementation of the rule. A second copy would eventually disagree, and
//! a tool-grant readout that disagrees with the harness is worse than none.
//!
//! ## What may be edited, and why that is the line
//!
//! The console edits what the console owns.
//!
//! An **overlay** teammate — one an operator defined through "Define an agent",
//! or the orchestrator created with `add_agent` — lives on the
//! [`CompanyRecord`], which this process writes. Its name, role and description
//! are editable here, and that is the whole of #264's "the roster is write-once
//! per member" complaint: before this, iterating on an agent's instructions
//! meant deleting it and starting over.
//!
//! A **manifest** teammate is declared in the version-controlled `company.toml`
//! — including every teammate from the global baseline, which is merged into
//! *every* company's roster. It used to be uneditable here, which meant the
//! agents a company actually ships with were the ones an operator could never
//! change: a hosted tenant has no `company.toml` to edit and nothing to
//! redeploy, so "edit it in the blueprint" was advice with no action behind it.
//!
//! It is editable now, through an
//! [`AgentOverride`](crate::ports::types::AgentOverride) layered on the record —
//! the shape #343 already used for the one field that was always editable, the
//! daily budget. Nothing rewrites `company.toml`: the blueprint keeps stating
//! what the company launched with, the overlay states what the operator has
//! since decided, and [`CompanyRecord::effective_agent`] is the single place the
//! two are resolved, so the console card and the built roster cannot disagree.
//! The merge is per field, so a field nobody edited still tracks the blueprint
//! across a redeploy.
//!
//! Removal works the same way — `DELETE …/team/{agent_id}` in
//! [`super::team`] records a tombstone rather than rewriting the blueprint —
//! and its only refusal is the company's last teammate.
//!
//! `tier` is read-only for both kinds: it has no override layer, and inventing
//! one is a policy decision rather than something to smuggle into a detail
//! view. `tools` is editable but admin-only, and can only ever *narrow* a
//! teammate within the company grant — see [`edit_agent`].
//!
//! The server states the rule rather than leaving the console to re-derive it:
//! every detail response carries an [`editable`](AgentDetailDto::editable) list,
//! and the console renders a field read-only exactly when the host says it is.
//! A console that decided this for itself would drift from what the host
//! actually accepts, and the operator would meet the disagreement as a failed
//! save.

/// # Why three fields are the exception (issues #619, #1245)
///
/// That reasoning covers what a teammate *is*. It does not cover what a
/// teammate may *do* or *run on*, and the three admin-gated fields are the
/// second thing — the [`AdminScopedCompany`](super::AdminScopedCompany) axis: a
/// write that settles something *on behalf of* the company rather than one a
/// member makes for themselves.
///
/// `tools` is the sharpest edge: **an empty `tools` list means "inherit the
/// company's standard grant"** — the widest grant the company has. So
/// `{"tools": []}` is not a small edit, it is a *widening*, and left
/// member-open it would let any signed-in member hand a deliberately-scoped
/// teammate the company's whole grant back. That is the exact inversion this
/// field was added to prevent, and `add_agent` already refuses its own version
/// of it (a narrowing that lands empty is a hard error there, never a stored
/// empty list).
///
/// `model` and `harness` are admin-gated for the same *kind* of reason without
/// that sharp edge: both are routing decisions the company owns rather than
/// details of the teammate. A model override names the inference this company
/// is paying for; a harness binding pins which serve set the teammate runs on.
/// Neither is a name or a role the account holder would edit for themselves, so
/// both sit with the grant on the admin side of the line.
///
/// So the admin check is **conditional on the fields being present**, in the
/// same shape and for the same reason as the cap on
/// [`add_member`](super::team): a member who edits a name or a role keeps
/// working exactly as before, and adding these fields must not quietly take an
/// existing capability away from members.
///
/// Being conditional is also what fixes its **position**: it runs after the
/// `409`/`404` checks, so an unknown id answers `404` whether or not the body
/// carried an admin-gated field. See the comment at the check itself.
///
/// Narrow-only-for-members was considered and rejected: it makes the scope a
