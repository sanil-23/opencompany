  // browser, a Column select set to Working reverted to Pending ~2.3s later and
  // never came back. Title, Note, Priority and Assignee went the same way.
  //
  // That also silently disarmed this dialog's dispatch confirmation. After the
  // reset `computeTaskPatch` returns `{}`, so `confirmDispatch` is false *and*
  // Save writes nothing — no confirmation, no request, no toast. The #351 gate
  // was only reachable by picking and saving inside the same ~150ms.
  //
  // Which side wins a conflict is the actual decision here, and it is **the

  // that moved the column to `done` would make an unrelated note edit also send
