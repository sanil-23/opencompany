/**
 * Which crossings are still being had, by the id of the row they fold onto.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The chip reads "asked @amendments · 1 message" from the moment the question
 * is journaled, which describes a crossing that finished after one reply. It
 * had not finished; the pair were still talking, and the count was whatever had
 * landed so far. A running exchange presented as a completed one is the fault —
 * the stale count was only how it showed.
 *
 * ## Why a context rather than a prop
 *
 * The chip is a leaf rendered from three places — the timeline, the thread
 * panel, and an agent's session — and none of them knows which desk it is
 * drawing, which is the key this state is held under. Threading it would mean
 * new props through three chains to reach one label.
 *
 * ## Why the row id, and not the two names
 *
 * `pair_conversation` sorts the pair, so two seats share ONE thread for every
 * crossing they ever have, whichever of them asked (`dm:amendments+
 * cancellations` held fourteen crossings in both directions in one live run).
 * Matching on the names would therefore mark every past crossing between those
 * two as running. The row a crossing folds onto is unique to it.
