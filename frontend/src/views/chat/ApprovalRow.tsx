// The gated calls one turn parked, raised inside the conversation that produced
// them (#379, consolidated by #842).
//
// The same content the Approvals page shows — headline, payload, asker, waiting
// time, and the grant-scope choice (#431), all from `@/components/approval-card`
// — laid out as a channel row so it reads as part of the thread rather than as a
// panel bolted beside it. Sharing the scope control rather than restating it is
// what keeps the two surfaces from offering different things for one approval.
//
// ## One card, however many calls (#842)
//
// A research turn that reaches three sites parks three approvals, and asking
// three times is the same fact told badly: it is one piece of work, and each
// interruption costs a re-dispatch cycle (#561) that can dead-end. So a batch
// renders as **one card with one Approve**, listing the hosts it covers.
//
// **All-or-nothing, deliberately.** Approve grants every call in the batch;
// Decline grants none. The operator is mid-conversation and wants one decision,
// not a form. Granularity is not missing — it lives on the Approvals page,
// which itemises the same parks one row at a time and is where an operator goes
// when they want precision or are cleaning up after the fact. Offering
// per-item control in both places would be redundant, and would double the
// state that has to stay in step between two surfaces.
//
// **What is not batched is the deciding.** One Approve resolves each item on
// its own id, so each approved call still mints its own host-scoped grant
// (#739) — three fetches produce three independently revocable standing
// permissions, exactly as they do today. Nothing about how grants are minted,
// stored or revoked changes here; only the asking is consolidated. There is no
// batch decision on the wire and no batch record on the host.
//
// A single-item batch renders exactly as this card did before #842: no list,
// no counts. The consolidation has to earn its extra furniture.
//
// The one thing it does differently from the page is how it resolves:
// **detached** (#391). The default resolve answers with the follow-up turn's
// replies, and rendering those here would put the continuation into the channel
// once from the POST body and again from its SSE echo. Detach has exactly one
// delivery path, so the duplicate-bubble race #391 deliberately left open
// outside chat POSTs cannot exist here.
