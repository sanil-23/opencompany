// Issue #580: the In-Review panel where an operator approves (or rejects) the
// workflow a builder pass proposed for a `workflow`-deliverable card.
//
// The road to #339's Done link. A card whose deliverable is `workflow`, dragged
// into In Progress, has the builder pass turn its plan into a proposed graph and
// settle it here — In Review, carrying a `TaskWorkflowProposal`. This panel is
// where a person reads that proposal and decides:
//
// * **Apply** runs the one workflow-authoring path host-side
//   (`POST …/workflow-proposal/apply`): it rebuilds the graph from the STORED
//   proposal, validates it exactly as a hand-authored create, links the card to
//   the created workflow, and returns it moved to Done — where #339's existing
//   output link opens the new workflow. A refused create (a name taken since, a
//   teammate off the roster) comes back rejected and the card stays In Review
//   with its proposal intact; the host's own message is shown verbatim, with the
//   per-node breakdown beneath it when the refusal carries one (issue #1191 —
//   the destination rules answer with `workflow_invalid` + `problems` now, so a
//   refused Apply names the node instead of only the sentence).
// * **Reject** clears the proposal and returns the card to To-do (decision D2c),
//   keeping its `workflow` deliverable so dragging it back builds again.
//
// The diff is the #415 renderer, fed by the {@link taskProposalDiff} adapter —
// the same review an operator gets for a copilot's edit, so a built workflow is
// approved with machinery that already exists. When the adapter cannot render
// the stored graph, Apply is withheld (the host would refuse it too) and the
// reason is shown; Reject stays available so a card is never stuck.
