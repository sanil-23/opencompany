/**
 * Show or hide the sidebar. A button in the header, not a row in the nav.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a row (issue #1177)
 *
 * It used to be a `SidebarMenuButton` — full width, icon then label, `h-8`,
 * `bg-sidebar-accent` on hover — sitting directly under the host switcher and
 * directly above Overview. That is the nav row shape exactly, so the eye filed
 * it as the first destination in the list. It is not a destination: everything
 * else in that column takes you somewhere, and this one changes the chrome and
 * leaves you where you are.
 *
 * Colouring it differently would not have fixed that; the shape is what says
 * "row". So it stops using the row primitive altogether and becomes the
 * console's ordinary icon button, in the sidebar's header — which is the part
 * of the column that talks about the panel rather than about the company.
 * `SidebarContent` below it is the destinations, and the header/content
 * boundary now means something.
 *
 * ## Why it does not crowd the host switcher (issue #1174)
 *
 * The switcher beside it is `h-12`, carries a filled glyph, a two-line
 * nameplate and the cross-host status dot. This is 28px, ghost, and dimmed at
 * rest. They also sit in separate elements, so hovering one never lights the
 * other — which is what stops the pair reading as a single control with a
 * chevron at one end and a panel glyph at the other.
 *
 * ## The collapsed rail
 *
 * The rail is `--sidebar-width-icon` (3rem) and `SidebarHeader` is `p-2`, so
 * there are 32px of content box — exactly the switcher's glyph, and no room
 * for anything beside it. The header row therefore becomes a column on the
 * rail (see `app-shell.tsx`), and this button grows to `size-8` there so it
 * lands on the same 32px rhythm as every nav icon below it.
 *
 * It deliberately drops the `bg-primary` fill it used to take when collapsed.
 * That fill existed to make it findable in a column of identical nav icons; up
 * here it has only the switcher for company, and the switcher's glyph is
 * *already* a filled primary square. Two of those stacked would read as one
 * control, which is the failure the paragraph above exists to prevent.
