 * a different mechanism. #1193 removed the mode; this keeps the route honest.
 *
 * Explicit addresses are untouched: a `#/company/desks` link, a `#/company/<deskId>`

  /**
   * Rebuild one thread's transcript from `chat/history` after its turn settled
   * (issue #983), folding into both stores — the parked Conversation reads
   * `threads`, the Chat workspace reads `transcripts`.
   *
   * ## Why this is not inside the poll effect, which is where it started
   *
   * It was, and there it never ran (issue #1000). The caller settles a turn by
   * deleting it from `openTurns`, and `openTurns` is the poll effect's own
   * dependency — so that delete re-renders, React tears the effect down, and
   * its cleanup sets `cancelled = true` long before a network round trip can
   * come back. The fold was guarded on that flag, so every durable re-read this
   * console ever issued was fetched, parsed and thrown away.
   *
   * Nothing reported it because the live `agent_reply` frame had almost always
   * drawn the same reply seconds earlier: a backstop that silently never fires
   * is indistinguishable from one that is never needed. What made it visible is
   * the hosted tenant, where the manager's proxy buffers whole response bodies
   * and an SSE stream therefore never delivers a frame at all
   * (`opencompany-microservice#23`). There the poll is not a backstop — it is
   * the only delivery path — and a detached turn's reply simply never appeared.
   *
   * So the lifetime that governs this read is the component's, not the effect's.
   * Unmount is the only thing that can make the answer unwanted, which is what
   * {@link mountedRef} says and `cancelled` never did.
   *
   * Idempotent by construction: both folds drop entries whose message id is
   * already present, so a second call for the same thread — a late poll tick, a
   * settle racing a re-arm — adds nothing.

   *
   * So it releases the held frames and renders them, exactly as the detached
   * path does, and leaves the live timeline alone for the same reason: those
   * rows are a running turn's only visible trace, and `onSendStart` cleared
   * them at the top of this POST, so anything still there arrived during it.
   *
   * What it pointedly does **not** do is fabricate a turn id. A throw carries
   * no turn id of its own, so the poll could not be armed from the failure
   * alone without risking a spinner that nothing would ever take down.
   *
   * But a throw is **not** proof the host never accepted the turn — a cut
   * connection after the host journaled it is the whole premise of this
   * feature — so the durable row may exist even though the response died.
   * Re-query the open rows and, if a matching `pending`/`running` turn for this
   * thread was journaled, register it. That arms the real poll-and-history
   * recovery path (issue #983), the only delivery that works when `/events` is
   * buffered or unavailable; the poll's terminal transition re-reads
   * `chat/history`, so the reply the host went on to write lands on screen
   * without relying on SSE. If no such row exists, nothing is armed and the
