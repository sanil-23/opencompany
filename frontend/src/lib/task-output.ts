// The card's link to what it produced (issue #339, epic #183 §6).
//
// A task that finished used to end as a chat message: prose in a conversation,
// with no durable thing to open, share, or hand to someone else. The host now
// stamps every successful attempt with a `TaskOutput`; this module turns that
// record into the one link a card shows, and into the addresses that link
// resolves to.
//
// # The precedence lives here and nowhere else
//
// A card shows **one** primary link — artifact, else workflow, else the run
// trace — and reaches the rest through the task detail. That primary is
// *derived* from the stamp on every render rather than persisted alongside it,
// so it can never contradict the list it came from. This module is the single
// site of that rule; the host deliberately stores the facts and not the choice.
//
// # Why the routes are query strings and not path segments
//
// `hooks/use-hash-view.ts` is the app's hash router, and its `canonicalize()`
// runs on **every** `hashchange`, rewriting the URL to at most `head/sub` — two
// segments. A third segment (`#/tasks/t-1/artifacts/a-1/3`) is therefore
// silently replaced away before anything can read it, which would make these
// links appear to work and then not.
//
// `readSegments()` strips everything after `?` before that comparison, and
// `canonicalize` early-returns when the two-segment path already matches — so a
// hash **query string** survives untouched. That is load-bearing, not a style
// choice: do not "tidy" these into path segments.
