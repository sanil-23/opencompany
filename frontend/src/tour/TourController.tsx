 * the download on the critical path of the click that starts one. "Replay tour"
 * would show a toast saying the tour was starting and then nothing visible
 * would happen until the chunk arrived, which on a cold cache or a slow
 * connection is long enough to read as a button that does not work.
 *
 * So the fetch is moved to the moment someone shows intent — pointing at the
 * button — instead of the moment they commit. By the time `session` flips and
 * `Suspense` asks for the module, the dynamic import has usually already
 * resolved and React renders it in the same frame.
 *
 * Safe to call as often as you like: `import()` caches its module promise, so
 * every call after the first is a lookup rather than a request. Failures are
 * swallowed because this is a prefetch and nothing depends on it — the real
 * `lazy` boundary will report a genuinely broken chunk when it renders.
