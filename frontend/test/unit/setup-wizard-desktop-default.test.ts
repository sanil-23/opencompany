/**
 * What the wizard answers on the operator's behalf when it is running inside
 * the desktop app.
 *
 * The packaged desktop is a `none`-mode host: one machine, one person, no
 * accounts, and no mailbox to send a link to. An instance an operator created
 * there still opens the wizard — that is the whole point of `RunSetupWizard` —
 * and the wizard would otherwise ask a question whose answer is already settled
 * by where it is running, and then ask for an address to go with the wrong
 * answer. Seeding the choice removes the address step entirely.
 *
 * It is a *preselection*, not a lock. Someone who wants to share their instance
 * with a colleague can still pick `email` on this very screen; the host reads
 * the mode back out of `config.toml` at the next launch, so the choice holds.
 *
 * Two conditions, and the second is not redundant: the console is the desktop
 * runtime, **and** the host it is talking to offers `none` at all. A desktop
 * console can be pointed at a remote host through the switcher, and a routable
 * host withholds `none` precisely because it would serve an unauthenticated
 * admin console — preselecting it there would send an operator into a mode the
 * apply is going to refuse.
