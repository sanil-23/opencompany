 * update it was issued to fetch.
 *
 * That is why an agent-to-agent DM rendered only after a reload: the live
 * `referral` frame triggered the re-read, the host returned the asking row with
 * its `referralConversation` folded in, and the id filter discarded it as
 * already-known (CodeRabbit, #2341).
