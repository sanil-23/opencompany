 *
 * `#/tasks/<id>` is the card detail, linked from chat, from an approval card,
 * from a workflow run's rows and from every card on the board — and Ledgers
 * deliberately reproduces none of what it shows. `#/tasks` is the page itself,
 * which an operator has in their history, their bookmarks and their fingers.
 * One has to keep resolving and the other has to land on the board, and both
 * failures are silent: a link that quietly shows Overview looks like a link
 * that worked.
