 * Issue #1311: `#/pages` resolved to Overview for four months. #1172 commented
 * the Pages row out of `NAV` and wrote a comment promising the route "stays
 * live", but routing was `NAV` plus a second hand-maintained list, and only the
 * first half of the treatment landed. The shell's `view === "pages"` block, its
 * `lazy()` import and the entire sandboxed-iframe Pages surface behind them
 * were unreachable code the whole time, and nothing said so.
 *
 * These tests import the REAL table from `@/lib/console-routes` rather than
 * transcribing it (which is what `task-route.test.ts` has to do for the shell's
 * `REWRITE_RETIRED`, and why a copy of the route table could rot unobserved).
