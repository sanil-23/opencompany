/**
 * Teammates on the Company page open (issue #1102).
 *
 * The chart drew every teammate it knew about and wired none of them: a staffed
 * row's name was plain text, and the "Not on a desk" chips were bordered pills
 * with no `href`, no handler and no tooltip — every visual signal of a control
 * and none of the behaviour. `AgentDetailView` had existed at `#/team/<agentId>`
 * (now `#/company/agent/<agentId>`) since #264, so the destination was never
 * missing; only the link was.
 *
 * These assertions read the DOM the operator actually gets, because the failure
 * is invisible to a type check and to every derivation test in
 * `org-tree.test.ts`: `buildOrgTree` was already correct, and stayed correct,
 * the whole time the surface was inert. What has to be pinned is that the
 * element is an **anchor with a real href** — not a `div` with an `onClick`,
 * which would type-check, look identical, and still break middle-click,
 * cmd-click, keyboard focus and the browser's own hover preview.
