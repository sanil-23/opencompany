/**
 * The sign-in question comes before its consequences.
 *
 * The wizard used to ask "what's your email?" one screen before it offered the
 * choice that decides whether an address is needed at all — and it offered that
 * choice buried inside Advanced, under copy inviting the operator to press
 * straight past it. So an operator on a laptop was asked for an address they
 * would never have had to supply had they seen that "no sign-in" was on the
 * table.
 *
 * What this file pins is therefore about *order and visibility*, not about any
 * one screen: the mode is asked first, and a host told it needs no sign-in is
 * never shown the address step at all — not disabled, not optional, absent,
 * with no slot of its own in the progress bar.
