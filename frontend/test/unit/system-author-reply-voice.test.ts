/**
 * One settled turn must read the same whether you watched it or loaded it.
 *
 * A capped turn posts two lines: the agent's partial write-up, then the host's
 * pause notice. The notice is authored `SYSTEM_AUTHOR`, so `fromHistory` gives
 * it `from: "system"` — a centred pill, not an agent bubble.
 *
 * The live renderers used to build a `company` message unconditionally and pass
 * the author through only as the channel. Because `mergeHistoryInOrder` keeps
 * the existing live object for a matching durable id, that first impression was
 * never corrected: whoever watched the turn kept an agent-style System bubble
 * forever, while whoever opened the transcript later saw the intended system
 * row. Two readings of one turn — the same "who actually said this" confusion
 * the pause-attribution fix set out to remove (Codex review on #2068).
