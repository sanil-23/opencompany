/**
 * Proof for issue #1653: a teammate's face is a way into who they are.
 *
 * The complaint is that an avatar was inert everywhere it appeared. You could
 * be three hundred lines into a channel, wonder what the agent answering you is
 * actually allowed to do, and have no way to find out that did not mean leaving
 * the conversation for `#/company/agent/<id>` and navigating back.
 *
 * So the evidence is the click that used to do nothing: open a DM, click the
 * teammate's face in the header, and read their persona, tier, desks and
 * resolved tool grants **over the transcript**. Then take the panel's own
 * offer — Edit agent — and land on their page with the form already open,
 * because a summary that cannot hand off to the real controls is a dead end of
 * its own.
 *
 * Runs against the same live host as `agent-detail.spec.ts`
 * (`companies/e2e_harness`), whose manifest declares `engineer` on the
 * Engineering desk. Default features are enough.
