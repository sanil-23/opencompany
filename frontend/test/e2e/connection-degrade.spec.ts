/**
 * The headline requirement, and the regression that comes with it.
 *
 * The console holds several OpenCompany hosts at once. The thing that makes
 * that worth having — and the thing that is easy to lose — is that the
 * connections are *independent*: one host being unreachable reddens one row in
 * the host switcher and leaves every other host's console working.
 *
 * Before this, failure was global. `App` held one phase, so a host that could
 * not be reached rendered a full-screen "Can't connect" over the whole app, and
 * a 401 anywhere dropped the entire console to a sign-in screen. With one host
 * that is indistinguishable from correct. With two it is the bug.
 *
 * block/buzz is the cautionary example and it is worth naming, because its
 * desktop *looks* like this: a rail of workspaces down the left edge. Only one
 * is live. Its `AppState` holds a single `relay_url_override`, its retention
 * database is scoped per community, and switching rows is a stateful apply that
 * re-resolves identity and restarts agents. The rail is the easy half; staying
 * genuinely N-at-once is the half this spec guards.
 *
 * The second host here is deliberately one that does **not** exist. A test that
 * needs two live servers is a test nobody runs; an unreachable address exercises
 * exactly the property under test — that a dead connection is contained.

 * console was told nothing about being named by the address it answers on
 * rather than by a constant, so two unnamed rows could not read identically
 * with only a dot colour between them.
 *
 * Every one of them reads a `host-row-…`, and the roster is hidden while the
 * product is scoped to one company per install (`src/product-scope.ts`,
 * `HOSTS_HIDDEN`). The degrade behaviour itself is untouched — the status probe,
 * the per-host error console and the naming rule all still run — so turning the
