/**
 * Regression proof for #922 — the theme switch must render a visible glyph
 * inside its own button, in both themes, however far down Settings is scrolled.
 *
 * `ThemeToggle` stacks a Sun and a Moon and cross-fades them with the `dark:`
 * variant, so the correct glyph is on screen at the first paint rather than
 * after `useTheme()` resolves. Stacking puts the Moon in `position: absolute`,
 * and `Button` is `position: static` — so the Moon resolved against the nearest
 * positioned ancestor instead of its button. On Settings that ancestor is
 * `SidebarInset`, which sits *outside* the view's own `overflow-y-auto`
 * scroller, and an absolutely-positioned box does not scroll with a container
 * that is not its containing block. The Moon therefore stayed pinned where the
 * unscrolled layout had put it while its button scrolled away, drifting down
 * the page by exactly `scrollTop`. In dark mode the Sun is `scale-0`, so what
 * was left behind was an empty 32x32 hit target: a card reading "Switch between
 * light, dark, and system themes" with no visible control, and a stray moon
 * glyph roughly 1300px further down the document.
 *
 * The assertion is deliberately geometric rather than a class check. `relative`
 * on the trigger is today's fix, but the contract is "the glyph is inside the
 * button", and any future restyle that breaks it — a different stacking trick,
 * a `transform` moved onto an ancestor — should fail here too.
 *
 * Scrolling is the load-bearing step. At `scrollTop: 0` the drift is zero and
 * the bug is invisible, which is how it shipped twice: the Appearance card is
 * near the bottom of Settings, so nobody reaches it without scrolling, and
 * nobody testing it at the top of the page sees anything wrong.
 *
 * `ThemeToggle` also renders in the company picker and on Login, where it sits
 * in a header at the top of a document-scrolled page. Both are latent cases of
 * the same fault rather than separate bugs, and the fix is in the shared
 * component, so this spec exercises the one call site that actually reproduced.
