/**
 * The console's shell is two layers, not two panes (issue #1178).
 *
 * The window *chrome* is painted exactly once, on the shell root. Both the
 * sidebar column and the margin around the content card are that one surface
 * showing through, and the routed page sits on a single inset, rounded card —
 * the only opaque sheet in the shell.
 *
 * # Why these assertions and not a screenshot
 *
 * The first attempt at this issue (PR #1188) inset the frame on three sides
 * over a flat tint and shipped a hairline sliver: structurally a two-layer
 * shell, visually nothing. Every geometric assertion below therefore names a
 * quantity rather than a class — a margin of at least 8px on the three sides
 * that face the window, a thinner but non-zero one under the title row that now
 * stands above the card, a real corner radius, a card fill measurably different
 * from the chrome — because "the class is present" is exactly what that change
 * would have passed.
 *
 * # The single-scrim property
 *
 * The seam this layout removes comes back the moment the sidebar paints a fill
 * of its own: two separately-tinted columns meeting at a line. So the test is
 * not "the sidebar and the frame are the same colour" — two different tokens
 * that happen to resolve alike would pass that and then drift. It is "the
 * sidebar's fill and the frame's fill are the *same painted element*", which is
 * a structural fact that cannot drift.
 *
 * Both themes, because the chrome steps *down* in lightness from the sheet in
 * light and *up* in dark — the canvas is already the darkest value in the dark
 * theme, so "further back" cannot mean darker there. A regression that only
 * flattens one theme is the likely one.
