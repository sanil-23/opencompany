/**
 * The live half of #2028: four **real** parked blockers, four real clicks, four
 * real resolves. Nothing about the decision is stubbed.
 *
 * Its sibling `approval-blocker-verdicts.spec.ts` intercepts the resolve and
 * asserts the body the console composes; it runs in every lane because it needs
 * no agent. This one lets each request reach the host and proves the other
 * half: the host accepts all four verdicts, and the one it acts on is the one
 * the operator clicked — not the two-value `approve`/`deny` the click rides on.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole issue. #2027 made all four verdicts work at the
 * engine while an operator could still reach only two, so a test that stops at
 * "the request was accepted" would have passed against the bug. The assertion
 * that does not is the resume note: the host writes a different sentence into
 * the blocker's thread for each verdict, so reading it back says which of the
 * four actually ran.
 *
 * ## The fixture is the product
 *
 * Each blocker is parked by asking the agent a question it cannot answer —
 * `escalate_to_human`, scripted through the mock brain. That is the real door:
 * a real turn, the real approval-request queue, a real park with a real thread
 * behind it. Nothing is written into the host's journal from outside, and
 * nothing has to be laid down before the run, so this proves the same thing on
 * a CI runner as it does on a laptop.
 *
 * ## Why it is gated
 *
 * An agent has to be able to call a tool for any of that to happen, which needs
 * the harness compiled in and an inference backend behind it. That is
 * {@link LIVE_BRAIN}, and the `Console E2E (live brain)` lane declares it.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT prove
 *
 * `escalate_to_human` parks with no {@link BlockerStep} by construction — the
 * tool has no run or card behind it — so this exercises the verdict surface and
 * the host's handling of it, not a workflow node re-entering. The node-level
 * consequences (a retry re-running the node once, a skip proceeding without
 * spending a turn, a cancel starting no run) are covered by the host's own
 * tests, which drive a real `BlockerStep::Node`. There is no console-reachable
 * way to park one of those, so it is not something this spec can honestly
 * assert.

/**
 * Parks one real blocker per verdict by asking the agent four questions it
 * cannot answer, and returns their approval ids keyed by verdict.
 *
 * **Four turns, one call each.** `escalate_to_human` now establishes the same
 * turn boundary `request_approval` always has (issue #2231): once a turn has
 * asked the operator something, every later sibling call in that turn is
 * refused rather than parked — "stop and wait for the decision" — even a
 * second, different question. Four calls bundled into one `__MOCK_PLAN__`
 * step, the way this used to work, now parks only the first and refuses the
 * other three, so each question needs its own turn.
 *
 * **One thread per verdict**, not one shared thread four times over: the host
 * quotes a channel's own prior messages back into the next prompt sent for
 * it, so a second `__MOCK_TOOL_CALL__` directive posted to the same channel is
 * a coin flip on which directive the mock brain actually serves. Four
 * channels that each see exactly one message sidesteps that outright, and
 * `noteCounts` below reads each verdict's resume note back off its own
 * channel to match.
 *
 * `detach: true` so each post returns before its turn finishes; the parks
 * happen inside that turn, so the queue is polled for them before moving on
 * to the next verdict. Each question carries a per-run stamp because this
 * suite shares one host and one data root — an approval another spec
 * legitimately parked must not be mistaken for one of these.
