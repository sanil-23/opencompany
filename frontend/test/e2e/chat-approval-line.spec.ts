/**
 * End-to-end proof for issue #368 — the line recording an approval decision is
 * written somewhere the operator can actually see it.
 *
 * It used to be appended to the literal `"main"`, which is the id of the first
 * *fallback* desk and of no channel on a company that defines its own. The
 * harness company defines `engineering` and `content` and nothing called
 * `main`, so both halves of the decision landed in a transcript bucket no
 * channel renders — the failure copy included, which is the half that matters:
 * a sign-off that did not go through looked exactly like one that did.
 *
 * The approvals themselves are mocked, and deliberately so. Parking a real one
 * needs a model that decides to make a costly call, and this is a test about
 * where the console *files the answer*, not about what the company asks for.
 * The decision POST is mocked for the same reason on the failure path: a host
 * that refuses the write is the case that has to stay visible, and it cannot be
 * provoked on demand.
 *
 * Needs a running host and is not a CI gate, like the rest of `test/e2e`.
