/**
 * Switching hosts is a navigation, and how that reads with exactly one host.
 *
 * It covered issue #1358: with two hosts and the second one down, picking the
 * dead host from the switcher pushed a history entry, so Back undid the switch
 * instead of silently spending the working host's route stack; a copied
 * address reopened the host it named, failure and all; and a host that could
 * not be reached could be forgotten from the failure screen itself.
 *
 * `HOSTS_HIDDEN` (`product-scope.ts`) is `false` again — the switcher's menu
 * opens on any host at all (`hostSwitcherMenu`'s own doc: "any host at all
 * opens a menu... a menu of one is not furniture once one is a menu of
 * something to *do*") — so this file is no longer about an inert trigger. The
 * two-host history cases above are restorable; this one case is what a single
 * connection — the shared E2E company's actual shape — still proves: the
 * menu names the host you are already on rather than offering nothing at all,
 * and selecting the row you are already on is a no-op, not a switch to undo.
