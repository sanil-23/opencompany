/**
 * End-to-end proof for issue #377 — a completed dispatch says so in the channel
 * the card came from.
 *
 * The defect this closes is a reader being **misled**, which is why it needs a
 * browser. A card dispatched from a channel can park in `paused` or bounce back
 * to `todo`, and all the channel showed was the agent's relay prose — so
 * someone watching the conversation, or arriving fresh after a reload,
 * reasonably concluded the work had finished. No unit test can observe that,
 * because the wrong impression is made of two correct halves: real prose, and a
 * missing structural line.
 *
 * Two tests, deliberately in two lanes:
 *
 * 1. **The addressing**, against a default host with a written stream. What
 *    went wrong historically in this file's neighbourhood was never the event —
 *    it was which channel it reached (#368 filed a decision into whatever
 *    channel was open; #367 filed live replies into a store the visible surface
 *    did not read). A default-feature host has no harness and cannot settle a
 *    dispatch, so the frames are written here, exactly as
 *    `chat-live-events.spec.ts` writes its `tool_call` rows for the same
 *    reason. This runs on every push.
 * 2. **The whole round trip**, behind the live-brain lane: a card raised from a
 *    channel, really dispatched, really settled by the harness, and — the half
 *    that only a reload can prove — still exactly one marker afterwards. The
 *    live line and its rehydrated twin are two different writers putting the
 *    same message into one transcript, which is precisely the shape that
 *    produced issue #483's duplicate.
