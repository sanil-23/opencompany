/**
 * Issue #615 — one "This computer" row, however many times the app restarts.
 *
 * The embedded host binds an ephemeral port on purpose, so its address is
 * different on every launch. The console recognised a host *by* that address,
 * so every launch read as a first meeting: a new connection id, a new row, and
 * the previous launch's row left behind pointing at a closed port. The registry
 * is durable, so they accumulated — all labelled alike, all but one broken.
 *
 * ## What is real here and what is not
 *
 * Everything the bug lives in is real: the built console, a live host, a real
 * browser, real `localStorage`, and a real page load per simulated launch. The
 * unit tests drive `adoptEmbeddedHost` directly; this drives the whole app
 * through the same door the desktop uses, which is the only way to catch the
 * bug re-entering through `App`'s wiring rather than the registry's.
 *
 * The one shimmed part is the Tauri bridge, and it has to be: `window.__TAURI__`
 * exists only inside the packaged shell, and no browser can produce one. The
 * shim below is not a mock of the behaviour under test — it answers
 * `oc_embedded` with an address and an identity, and proxies `oc_request` to
 * `fetch`, which is what the Rust core does. Every decision this spec asserts
 * on is made by the console's own code.
 *
 * The identity the shim reports is read from the host's own `/spec`, not
 * invented, because in the real desktop both come from one instance over one
 * data root. A fixture that let them differ would be testing a state that
 * cannot occur.
 *
 * ## A page load is a launch
 *
 * The init script advances a counter in `localStorage` and hands out the next
 * address, so `page.reload()` is a relaunch: new port, same machine. The last
 * address is the live host, so the connection that survives the sequence is one
 * that genuinely answers — the difference between "the rows collapsed" and "the
 * row that remains is the working one".
