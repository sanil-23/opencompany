/**
 * The console's scrollbars are themed, thin, and only bright while a pane is
 * moving (issue #1109).
 *
 * # This is characterisation cover, and it passes on `main`
 *
 * Nothing here is new behaviour. #1109 landed the themed scrollbars and the
 * `data-scrolling` mark; what it did not land was a browser test, and every
 * property below is one only a browser can see. It is written now because
 * issue #1178 rebuilt the shell those panes live in and asked for the
 * scrollbars to be verified — so the honest thing is a test that describes what
 * already ships, rather than one that claims to prove a change it did not make.
 *
 * Three properties, and each one is invisible to a unit test:
 *
 *   1. **The gutter is the console's, not the platform's.** Chromium paints a
 *      15px system scrollbar; `index.css` narrows every scroller in the app to
 *      10px through `::-webkit-scrollbar`. That rule set is silently dropped in
 *      Chromium the moment anything sets the standard `scrollbar-width` /
 *      `scrollbar-color` properties on the same element — the trap the
 *      stylesheet warns about at length — and nothing but a real browser can
 *      tell you it happened.
 *   2. **The geometry never changes.** Only the thumb's *colour* animates. If a
 *      future change hides the bar by collapsing its width, every scroll would
 *      reflow the content beside it. Measured here rather than argued.
 *   3. **`data-scrolling` lands on the pane that actually scrolled.** `scroll`
 *      does not bubble, so one capture-phase listener at the document covers
 *      every pane including ones mounted later (`lib/scroll-activity.ts`). The
 *      failure mode this rules out is `:hover`'s: a mark that spreads to every
 *      ancestor up to `<html>`, lighting every nested scroller at once.
