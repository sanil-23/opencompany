/**
 * Issues #260 / #261 / #262: how the workflow graph form validates input and
 * gives feedback.
 *
 * These three are one behaviour seen from three sides — a rule stated once
 * (#260), stated *early* (#261), and stated back in plain English (#262) — so
 * they are pinned together, in the browser, against the live host.
 *
 * The browser is the only place two of these are real. Blur validation is a
 * DOM event and a render, not a function call: the unit-testable part
 * (`destinationTargetProblem`) was already correct before #261 and would stay
 * green while the error rendered nowhere, or rendered under a control the
 * author can no longer see. And the cron preview's whole job is to show a
 * *round trip* — debounce, request, response, two clock renderings — which
 * cannot be observed anywhere else.
 *
 * ## Where the form went
 *
 * Every test here used to open **New workflow** and start filling fields in.
 * Creating a workflow is now one description box, so that route reaches a dialog
 * with none of these controls on it — and this file was the only coverage the
 * graph form's feedback had.
 *
 * It is re-routed rather than deleted, along the two routes the form actually
 * has (`test/e2e/workflow-dialog.ts`), and which route each test takes is a
 * decision about what the test is *about*:
 *
 * - **an edit**, for everything that is a fact about the form's controls. There
 *   is one implementation of them — `createSurface` chooses when the form
 *   renders, never what it is — so a blur error, a kind swap, a cron preview and
 *   the host pre-flight are the same events either side of it. This is also the
 *   honest route: editing is how an operator meets these controls now.
 * - **a create the host refused**, for the three that are facts about *create
 *   mode* — an id that can still be typed, the created-paused disclosure, and
 *   `validate()`'s own complaints. That route is not a workaround for reaching
 *   them: it is the one route the create form has left, and a browser is the
 *   only place its existence can be proved.
 *
 * What is NOT here any more is "a valid workflow still saves" as a *create*. The
 * create write is pinned in `workflow-one-box-create.spec.ts`, through the box
 * that now performs it; the save write is pinned below by the pre-flight test,
 * which ends by saving the graph the host approved and reading it back.
 *
 * Runs against the live host the harness brings up (see `playwright.config.ts`).
 */

/**
 * Every cron-preview assertion waits on a round trip the other assertions in
 * this file do not: a 350 ms debounce, then a request to the host, then a
 * render. Playwright's default `expect` timeout is 5 s and the config's
 * `timeout` governs the whole test, not each assertion — so on a slow host
 * these are the assertions that flake first. Stated explicitly rather than
 * inherited.
