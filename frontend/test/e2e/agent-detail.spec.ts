/**
 * Proof for issue #264: an agent can be opened, read, and edited **from the
 * Console**, against the live host.
 *
 * The issue's complaint is a dead end, so the evidence has to be the walk that
 * used to end nowhere: start on the Team tab, open a card, and read the things
 * that had no console surface at all — the instructions the agent was defined
 * with, its tier, the tools it may actually use, and the desks it sits on. The
 * tool grants had no *read endpoint* either (`GET …/team` sent `tools: null`
 * for every member), so this is also the first time that is checkable from
 * outside the process.
 *
 * Runs against the same live host as `wiring.spec.ts` (`companies/e2e_harness`),
 * whose manifest is what the assertions below are pinned to:
 *
 *   * `[tools] allow = ["composio", "mcp:*", "workspace", "workspace.*"]`
 *   * `ceo` is `tier = "orchestrator"`, asks for `mcp:*`, `composio`,
 *     `workspace.read`, and sits on no desk
 *   * `engineer` sits on the Engineering desk
 *
 * Default features are enough: the routes this exercises ship in the default
 * build, so nothing here is behind `capabilities.ts`.
 *
 * The spec removes the teammate it creates, so it can run repeatedly against a
 * host whose data directory persists between runs.

/**
 * A fresh host greets the first visit with a welcome tour rendered over the
 * console, which swallows clicks on the view beneath it.
 *
 * Two halves, and the first is what matters. The tour is suppressed **before
 * the app boots** by seeding its own localStorage markers through an init
 * script, so it never renders and there is nothing to wait for. This is the
 * pattern `board-columns.spec.ts` uses, and it is here for a measured reason:
 * the earlier version of this helper blocked on `waitFor({ timeout: 15_000 })`
 * and swallowed the timeout, which costs the FULL fifteen seconds every time
 * the tour is absent — the common case. This spec navigates three times (the
 * `beforeEach`, the storage-cleared reload, and the cleanup), so it paid that
 * toll three times and blew the 60s test budget without a single assertion
 * failing.
 *
 * The click half stays as a belt-and-braces fallback for a host whose marker
 * key this list does not name, but it polls briefly rather than blocking.
