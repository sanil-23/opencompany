/**
 * What the host under test can actually do, so a spec that needs more than the
 * default build can say so instead of failing (issue #428).
 *
 * # Why these are opt-in variables and not a probe of the host
 *
 * A probe would be better, and there is very nearly one: `GET /tiny` reports
 * the vendored runtime modules. It cannot be used for this. `openhuman` is
 * reported as `enabled: true` unconditionally — the field describes the
 * vendored *checkout*, not the `openhuman` cargo feature — so a default build
 * answers exactly like a feature-gated one. A probe that cannot distinguish the
 * two would skip nothing, or skip everything, and would look authoritative
 * while doing it.
 *
 * So the caller declares what it brought. That is honest about where the
 * knowledge lives: whoever built the binary and started the inference backend
 * is the only party that knows.
 *
 * # The skips now have a lane behind them (issue #467)
 *
 * Four of the suite's best specs sit behind `LIVE_BRAIN`, and they are the ones
 * that exercise the product rather than the console's own rendering. CI runs
 * them: `Console E2E (live brain)` builds `--features openhuman,mcp`
 * and `playwright.config.ts` stands up `mock-brain.mjs` and `mcp-server.mjs`
 * behind it. The default-feature `Console E2E` lane still skips them, because
 * on a host without the harness the thing they test is not compiled in — that
 * skip is a true statement about that host, not a debt.

 *
 * The same reason {@link FIRST_RUN} is: the two lanes need different hosts.

 *
 * ## Why this is a separate run and not a skip inside the spec
 *
 * First-run setup opens only on a company nobody has staffed, and every company
 * under `companies/` except this fixture declares a roster of its own. So
 * `company-setup.spec.ts` cannot pass against the harness company and the
 * harness company cannot serve the rest of the suite — two hosts, therefore two
 * runs.
 *
 * It used to be one run with a `test.skip` inside the spec, and that is the
 * shape issue #1404 was half about: the guard read the roster, found the global
 * baseline on it, and skipped **every time**, so the lane reported green over a
 * feature that could not open at all. `CLAUDE.md` names this exact pathology for
 * Rust targets — "builds, runs and reports zero without failing anything".
 *
 * The replacement has three parts, and all three are needed:
 *
 *   1. {@link playwright.config.ts} selects the first-run spec **only** in a
 *      first-run run, and every other spec **only** outside one, so neither can
 *      be pointed at a host it cannot pass against;
 *   2. the spec asserts its host is the right one instead of skipping, so a
 *      mispointed run fails loudly on the first line rather than quietly on all
 *      of them;
 *   3. `Console E2E (first run)` in CI runs it, through
 *      `scripts/ci/assert-e2e-spec-ran.sh`, which fails on a reported count of
 *      zero — a number, because a configuration can look right and be vacuous.

 *
 * ## Why a lane rather than one more spec in the live-LLM run
 *
 * The same reason {@link FIRST_RUN} and {@link LIVE_LLM} are lanes: it needs a

 * whose roster is a CEO, an engineer and a writer; this spec drives a lab whose

 *
 * It also wants a data root of its own, for the reason the first-run lane does:
 * the answers ledger is read at the end of a run, and a root still holding the
 * previous run's rows would let a stale answer pass for a fresh one.
 *
 * Like the live-LLM lane it is **not** run by CI — real tokens, tens of

 *
 * ## Why a lane rather than screenshots inside the specs that already exist
 *
 * Because a screenshot answers a different question, and answering it in the
 * wrong place would degrade the specs that already work. `shell-two-layer.spec.ts`
 * says outright why it asserts geometry instead of pixels: a sliver of inset
 * over a flat tint is structurally a two-layer shell and visually nothing, and
 * only a named quantity — eight pixels on all four sides, a fill measurably
 * different from the chrome — fails that. Every such assertion in this suite is
 * a claim someone can read, and none of them should become "it looks like it
 * did last week".
 *
 * What a baseline catches is the complement: the regression nobody had a
 * quantity for. A token that changed lightness everywhere, a font that stopped
 * loading and fell back, a card that lost its padding on one view out of nine.
 * No geometric assertion names those because nobody knew to write one, and they
 * are exactly what a reviewer notices in a screenshot within a second.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a required check
 *
 * Baselines are per-platform — Playwright suffixes them with the platform name,
 * and the ones committed here were generated on `linux`. A contributor on macOS
 * regenerates their own on first run; a required check that fails for everyone
 * who is not on the recording platform teaches people to pass `-u` reflexively,
 * which is how a baseline suite stops meaning anything. It is a tool for
 * looking at a change, not a gate on merging one.
 *
 * Run it before and after a styling change and read the diff Playwright writes
 * into `playwright-report/`. Re-record with `npm run e2e:visual:update` — and
 * read what you re-recorded, because accepting a diff is the whole risk here.
