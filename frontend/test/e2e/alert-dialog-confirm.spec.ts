/**
 * Regression proof for #268 — confirming an `AlertDialog` must dismiss it.
 *
 * `AlertDialogAction` used to render a plain `Button` while `AlertDialogCancel`
 * rendered the primitive's `Close`, so only *cancelling* closed the dialog.
 * Confirming ran the handler, the underlying action succeeded, and the popup
 * stayed mounted — its backdrop marking the rest of the console inert and
 * swallowing every subsequent click until a reload.
 *
 * Both tests hold the confirm handler's request open, because the interesting
 * moment is the one *between* the click and the response. That window is where
 * the bug lives, and holding it makes the assertion deterministic rather than a
 * race: while the request is in flight the dialog must already be gone. It also
 * removes the thing that used to mask the bug — on the delete path the console
 * navigates away once the request lands, which unmounts the stuck dialog and
 * makes a naive "is it hidden eventually?" assertion pass even on `main`.
 *
 * The dialog being *hidden* is only half of it. A popup that has animated out of
 * sight but left an inert backdrop behind is the same bug, so each test also
 * clicks its way back through the surface underneath with Playwright's
 * actionability checks on: an intercepting backdrop fails that click rather than
 * passing silently.
 *
 * The call site exercised is the task delete inside `TaskEditDialog`. It used to
 * be joined by `SettingsView`'s lifecycle `ConfirmAction`, on the argument that
 * the fix lives in the shared primitive (`components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`) and
 * not at any one caller — but that confirm guarded `Suspend`, and issue #1401
 * removed it from a console signed in as a person: `suspend` is a
 * `PlatformScope` route, so the dialog took a confirmation and then answered
 * `401`. A spec cannot drive a button that is correctly no longer there, and
 * `lifecycle-platform-scope.spec.ts` now covers why it is gone. The remaining
 * confirms all need state this spec would have to build first — a live
 * in-flight run (`TaskDetailView`), a declared list (`ManageListsView`) — so the
 * primitive is proven once here rather than badly twice.
 *
 * Like the rest of `test/e2e`, this drives a *running* host and is not wired
 * into CI — the Playwright config declares no `webServer`. It is a reproduction
 * and a written-down contract, not a merge gate.
