/**
 * The policy screen must state whether policy-generated approvals (the
 * always-ask list, the spend cap, the tier) are actually creating approval
 * cards, and it must be reading that from the running host rather than
 * assuming it in the console's own TypeScript.
 *
 * The harness company (`companies/e2e_harness/company.toml`) runs with
 * policy-generated HITL disabled, like every host this suite can drive today
 * (`src/runtime/builder.rs` disables it unconditionally on the production
 * path) — so this spec pins the "disabled" half against the real, running
 * server: the honest banner, the two "(inactive)" fields, and the fact that
 * neither is a Save an operator can press. It is the case
 * `settings-authority.spec.ts` does not cover: that spec checks who is
 * offered the tier controls, not whether the always-ask list and spend cap
 * tell the truth about their own status.
 *
 * Drives a real browser against a live host, like the rest of this
 * directory, and is not a merge gate (the Playwright config declares no
 * `webServer` override here beyond the shared one).
