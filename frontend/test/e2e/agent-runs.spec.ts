/**
 * Proof for issue #1573: a teammate's run history is reachable against the
 * live host.
 *
 * The claim under test is one no unit render can make, because it spans the
 * whole stack: the console asks for `?agent=`, a real `RunStore` answers it
 * from its index, and the rows that come back are this teammate's attempts and
 * nobody else's. A stubbed `listRuns` proves the component; only a host proves
 * the selector.
 *
 * The walk navigates to `/#/company/agent/engineer` and accepts either a populated
 * attempt list or the "hasn't run yet" state — whether the host's data
 * directory holds any attempts decides which, and both are correct. The
 * journey is the operator's, and it had no surface at all before this.
 *
 * Default features are enough: the harness company boots on the offline echo
 * brain, and whichever state the section lands in must render without error.
