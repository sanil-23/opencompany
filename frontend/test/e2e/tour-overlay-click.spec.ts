/**
 * A click on the dimmed page during the tour must not navigate.
 *
 * # The failure this reproduces
 *
 * react-joyride draws a full-page overlay with a cutout around the current
 * stop's target, and its `overlayClickAction` defaults to `close` — which under
 * `continuous` advances the run. So a click on anything outside the cutout hit
 * the overlay rather than the element under it: the element's own handler never
 * ran, the tour stepped forward, and `TourController`'s `before` hook drove the
 * console to the next stop's view. The first stop is the Room, so an operator
 * clicking a teammate on Company landed in `#/chat/main` with no teammate open.
 *
 * Captured from the running console on the parent commit — the click's own
 * `composedPath` was:
 *
 *     path → svg[spotlight] → div.react-joyride__overlay → …
 *
 * It was reported twice, as a teammate card and as a workflow card, which is
 * what one cause looks like from outside; the cards were never involved. Every
 * clickable surface reached during a tour behaved this way, and a first-time
 * operator meets the tour on their first visit to a company.
 *
 * # Why this is only a browser test
 *
 * The fix is one option on a prop, and a unit test asserting that option is set
 * would be the same literal written twice — it would pass on a build where the
 * prop never reached joyride. What must be true is that joyride *receives* the
 * policy and stops treating its backdrop as a control, which only a real
 * overlay in a real browser can answer. Same split `tour-completion-persists`
 * describes for issue #1408.
 *
 * # Why the precondition assertion is not optional
 *
 * The first version of this spec passed against the broken build. The overlay's
 * cutout moves with the stop's target and the roster reflows with the viewport,
 * so at a smaller viewport the click landed on the page rather than on the
 * overlay and the spec asserted nothing at all — green, for the wrong reason.
 * `expectOverlayCovers` pins the condition the test needs to be exercising, so
 * a layout change turns this into a failure rather than a silent pass. The
 * viewport is fixed here for the same reason.
