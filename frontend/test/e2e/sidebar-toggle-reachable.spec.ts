/**
 * However the sidebar is hidden, there is always a way back to it.
 *
 * Two shapes, because the sidebar has two. On mobile it is a sheet that closes
 * entirely, taking its own controls with it, so the way back is a button
 * docked in its own chrome bar below the page. On desktop it collapses to a
 * 3rem icon rail, and the way back is a control that never belonged to the
 * column in the first place.
 *
 * The desktop half also pins WHERE that control lives. It used to be a
 * full-width row directly above Overview — the nav row shape exactly, for
 * something that is not a destination (issue #1177) — then a button in the
 * sidebar's header, which put the control that *hides* a panel inside the panel
 * it hides. It now sits on the leading seam of the content card, outside the
 * sidebar entirely, and the assertions that it is absent from `sidebar` and
 * from `sidebar-content` and centred on that seam are what stop it drifting
 * back into either. They are deliberately paired with the reachability claims
 * rather than filed on their own: a control that is in the right place but
 * unreachable, or reachable but nameless, is the same bug in a different coat.
 *
 * The mobile half used to be `position: fixed`, floating over whatever content
 * happened to scroll into the same bottom-left corner and winning every
 * hit-test there (issue #1265). It is now a normal-flow bar that reserves its
 * own row instead of overlaying one, which is what the overlap test below
 * pins down.
