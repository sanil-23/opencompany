/**
 * Issue #528 / #514: a run the host refuses because the company has no inference
 * provider surfaces as a PERSISTENT, actionable banner — not a vanishing
 * raw-string toast.
 *
 * #514 gives the host a `409 { code: "inference_required" }` for this exact
 * state (a company that never configured an inference source). The console keys
 * on that structured `code` — never the localisable prose — raises a banner that
 * says what is wrong in plain words, and links the operator straight to the
 * inference settings so the dead-end toast becomes a way forward.
 *
 * Needs no brain: the refusal is injected with `page.route`, so this runs in
 * BOTH the default `Console E2E` lane and the live-brain lane.
