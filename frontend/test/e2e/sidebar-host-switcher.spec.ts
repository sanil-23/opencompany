/**
 * The host switcher, in the sidebar header, on a console holding two hosts.
 *
 * This spec used to guard the opposite arrangement: an icon rail down the left
 * edge, and a `position: fixed` sidebar that had to be offset by 56px or it
 * slid underneath and clipped every nav label — "Company" read as "mpany".
 * Issue #1142 removed the rail and moved the choice into the sidebar's own
 * header, so the offset is gone and the assertion inverts: the sidebar now
 * starts at the left edge of the window, and nothing stands in front of it.
 *
 * What carries over is why the spec exists at all. The broken state needed two
 * connections, and nothing else in the suite creates them — a design-system
 * migration and two contrast audits all passed straight over it, because every
 * one of them ran against the default single-host console. `HOSTS_HIDDEN`
 * (`product-scope.ts`) is `false`, so even one host now opens the switcher's
 * menu; two hosts is what still lets this spec see the menu carry more than
 * one row and a "second host" to render as unreachable — the shape a
 * single-host console cannot exercise.
