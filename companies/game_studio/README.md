## Agent roster

| Agent | Responsibility |

## Human in the loop

Humans keep **creative and design direction**; the agents run everything else. The output of this harness is **shippable games**.

## Tool servers

Engine and middleware documentation, plus the issue tracker a shipping game's feature and balance work is planned in.

Declared in [`mcp.json`](mcp.json) and merged with anything the install
ships and anything an operator adds from the console. A server marked
*needs a token* is declared but off: write its credential from
Settings → Connections, then enable it there.

| Server | What it is for | Ships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deepwiki` | Documentation and Q&A for any public GitHub repository. Public and no-auth. | on |
| `context7` | Version-accurate API and library documentation, so answers match the release in use. | on |
| `linear` | Issues and cycles, when the work is tracked outside this board. Needs a token. | off — needs a token |
