## Agent roster

## Human in the loop

Humans keep **editorial standards**; the agents run everything else. The output of this harness is **published, distributed stories**.

## Tool servers

Drafts, source notes and the corrections log live in a shared workspace.

Declared in [`mcp.json`](mcp.json) and merged with anything the install
ships and anything an operator adds from the console. A server marked
*needs a token* is declared but off: write its credential from
Settings → Connections, then enable it there.

| Server | What it is for | Ships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notion` | The workspace this company's documents already live in. Needs a token. | off — needs a token |

## Run it
