# Dynamic ledgers

A company keeps more than a task board. It keeps goals, decisions, risks,
customer promises, experiments run, invoices chased — and every one of those is
the same shape: **a set of rows with an id, a status, some prose, and a reason
each closed one closed.**

Before this, exactly one of those shapes was first-class. `TaskStore` had six
hard-coded columns, and every other axis a company needed was written into a
note, a chat message, or a workspace file nobody designed. The company's own
record of what it had decided was prose scattered across three surfaces, and
nothing could search it, bound it, or stop a teammate re-deciding it next week.

So the shape is **declared** rather than compiled. A `LedgerSpec` names its
fields, its statuses, which of them close a row, and how the rendered file is
laid out; one engine folds an append-only log into rows and renders a built-in
and a company-declared ledger identically. The runtime ships three
(`tasks`, `goals`, `decisions`) and a company writes the rest, up to
`MAX_DECLARED` (12).

## The four rules

### Append-only, and every write is a merge

There is one write operation. Opening a row, amending it, blocking it, closing
it and re-prioritising it are all *record an event against this id*; the fold
applies events in order and leaves absent keys alone. Closing a goal is
`{status: "met", reason: "shipped in March"}` and nothing else.

That is not simplification for its own sake. A vocabulary of operations means a
vocabulary of **inverses** to get wrong — what `unblock` does to a row that was
never blocked, whether `reopen` restores the old status or the default — and
every one of those is a decision the fold would have to make silently. A merge
has no inverse to get wrong, and the log keeps the history either way.

It also fixes what a rewritten-whole board loses. Storing *current state* loses
**why** (a card that moved to Done records the landing, not the verdict) and
loses **what was there before** (a rewrite that drops a row is byte-identical to
a rewrite that never had it, so a bug that eats work looks exactly like work
nobody did).

A JSON `null` clears a field — the one thing a merge cannot otherwise express.

### Agents create and record; only people delete

`AuthorKind::may_delete` is that rule, in one place. It is not a permission
setting and it is not configurable.

An agent's whole relationship with a ledger is **additive**: it opens rows,
amends them, and closes them with a reason, and every one of those is
recoverable by reading the log. Deletion is not, and a runtime where a turn can
erase the record of what it did is one whose record means nothing. Being
finished with a row is `close_entry`, which keeps the reason — and the reason is
the entire value of a closed row to whoever reads it next.

`AuthorKind::System` is deliberately **not** exempt: a sweep that could delete
rows is the same loss with nobody to ask about it.

Concretely:

| | agent | person | platform credential |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| read, record, close | yes | yes | yes |
| declare a ledger | yes | yes | yes |
| delete a row | no | **yes** | no |
| retire a ledger | no | **yes** | no |

The asymmetry on *declare* is the point. A company discovers which axes it needs
while it is running, so a declaration that required an operator would be
discovered and then not made. What an agent cannot do is undo one.

Enforcement lives in `company::ledgers` and nowhere else. The REST routes turn
`ScopedCompany::actor` into a `LedgerAuthor` and the agent tools stamp the
teammate — both then call the same service. A route that decided for itself
would be a second answer to the question, and the tools would need a third.

### Everything renders into `derived/`, and nothing hand-writes it

Every ledger renders one Markdown file into `derived/<NAME>.md` in the company's
shared workspace, rewritten on every write to that ledger. That is what makes a
ledger legible to everything that already reads the workspace — an agent's file
tools, the console's workspace view, a search, an export — without any of them
learning a new API.

The rule is not *these particular files are generated*; it is **nothing in this
folder is hand-written**. A per-file rule fails open: a ledger declared next week
renders a file no guard has heard of, somebody edits it, the edit is silently
erased by the next derivation, and they have no way to know. The folder rule
fails closed.

`DerivedGuardWorkspace` is that guard — a `WorkspaceStore` decorator wrapped at
the single place the store is chosen, so every writer obeys without knowing it
does (the same argument `QuotaEnforcedWorkspace` and `WorkspaceAnnouncer` make).
It refuses `write`, `create`, `adopt_or_create_folder`, `rename_move` (in **and**
out), and the binary writes. `WorkspaceOrigin::Seed` passes, which is what the
runtime's own derivation stamps.

**Deleting is deliberately allowed.** A delete is not the failure this exists to
prevent: nothing is silently lost, the next write re-derives the file, and a
retired ledger has to leave something somebody can clear.

The refusal is **per ledger**, not generic, because *what to do instead* differs:
an events ledger takes `record_entry` and the task board does not. Telling the
board's caller otherwise sends them to a tool that refuses them a second time —
a refusal naming the wrong remedy is barely better than one naming none.

### Bounds are code, not intent

A ledger's rendered file is read by people in the console **and** routed into
agent turns, so its size is a bill paid on every read. Every section is clamped
against `budget::MAX_LISTED` (40 rows) and every prose field against
`REASON_CHARS` (600) **on the way in**, so a declaration cannot grow its own file
past what a reader is asked to hold. Clamped rather than refused, so a ledger
stored when the bound was looser keeps rendering after the bound tightens.

Either bound alone is the same file by another route: forty rows of
five-kilobyte prose is not bounded. The ceiling test asserts both, and asserts
the property a ceiling alone cannot catch — *past the bound, more rows must not
mean more file*.

A section cut to its bound while reading as complete is worse than a long one,
because the reader concludes there is nothing more and re-proposes what was cut.
So every truncation says how many it dropped and names the call that fetches
them.

## The task board is the `tasks` ledger

`tasks` is `LedgerSource::Native`: its rows stay in `TaskStore` and its columns
keep firing dispatch, planning passes and run settles. None of that is
expressible as a declaration and none of it should be — a declared status cannot
open an attempt, and a company that could redefine `in_progress` into something
that does not dispatch has broken its own runtime from a JSON file.

It is registered so `list_ledgers` names **every** ledger and `read_ledger`
reads every ledger. A discovery surface that covers the ledgers a company
invented but not the one it already had is a surface an agent stops trusting,
and then stops using.

### One table, two vocabularies

The board's columns lived in three places that could not check each other: a
`[&str; 6]` on the port, a `match` from id to label beside it, and a
hand-maintained `TASK_COLUMNS` in the console — whose own comment admitted the
cost: *"a Rust test cannot see the TS list, so a column added on one side and
not the other keeps this green."* A column present on one side alone either
never rendered (its cards silently vanished) or was refused by the write
boundary.

`ledger::board` is now the one declaration, and since issue #1512 it carries two
vocabularies over one set of rows:

* a **stage** (`COLUMNS`) — the six lifecycle states, unchanged. Persisted,
  matched on by the dispatch edge, never widened.
* a **phase** (`PHASES`) — the three states everything that reads the board is
  shown: `pending`, `working`, `done`.

Everything else derives:

| consumer | what it takes |
| --- | --- |
| `ports::tasks::BOARD_COLUMNS` | the stage ids, via a `const fn` — still a genuine `const` |
| `ports::tasks::column_label` | the labels, of either vocabulary |
| the `tasks` ledger declaration | one status per **phase**, one section per phase |
| the console | the ledger's `statuses`, labels included, over the wire |
| `TaskCard.column` / `.stage` | the phase, and the stage when there is one |

Adding a phase or a stage is one edit. The labels are pinned in Rust by
`the_labels_are_the_ones_every_surface_renders` — an assertion that was
impossible to write while the console kept a copy.

The phases exist because six lifecycle states is the right number for the
runtime and the wrong number for a reader; the four middle stages are one column
now, and the stage rides on the row instead. The full argument, the mapping
table and what a write takes are in
[ledger-statuses.md](./ledger-statuses.md).

**The ids stay leaf constants.** `COLUMN_IN_PROGRESS` and its siblings remain
plain `&str` consts on the port, and the table refers to them: entering
`in_progress` *dispatches the card* and the edge keys off that exact literal, so
a stage's identity has to be something a `match` arm can name. Only its
presentation and its grouping moved.

**And the table is not itself declarable.** A company may declare any ledger it
likes, but not this one: a stage here is a lifecycle state that spends money.
`planning` fires a model call, `in_progress` opens an attempt, and `done` is
reachable only through a human verdict. A seventh stage from a JSON file would
be a state the runtime has no edge for, and a card that entered it would sit
there forever with nothing to say why.

`done` is the only closed phase: a card in review or paused is *stopped*, not
finished, and calling either closed would make "what is still outstanding"
answer wrong.

## How many statuses a ledger may declare

Three for everything the runtime ships, five for the authored templates, and
every retired word kept as an alias so no stored row disappears. See
[ledger-statuses.md](./ledger-statuses.md).

## What a declaration cannot do

- **It cannot reason.** `Check` is a closed set — a required field, an unknown
  status, a close with no reason. There is no expression language: a company
  that could write predicates into a ledger declaration has written a rules
  engine nobody can review.
- **It cannot raise a bound** (see above).
- **It cannot shadow a built-in**, so `tasks` is always the board and every
  prompt and route naming it stays right.
- **It cannot claim another ledger's derived path.** Two writers on one file is
  how each one's work disappears.
- **It cannot be `native`**, which is for ledgers the runtime renders in Rust.

A declaration that breaks one of these is skipped **with a fault** rather than
failing the registry: a company that wrote one bad ledger must still reach its
board. The faults ride the listing so the company can see why something stopped
appearing.

## Where a declaration comes from

Three places, all producing the same [`LedgerSpec`] and all held to the rules
above:

| source | authored in | when it lands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| built-in | `src/ledger/registry.rs`, in Rust | always; never stored, so a company's copy cannot drift from the code every prompt is written against |
| the global baseline | `globals/ledgers/<slug>.toml` | seeded into the company's store at first boot |
| the company's own bundle | `companies/<name>/ledgers/<slug>.toml` | seeded at first boot, replacing a baseline declaration of the same slug |
| an agent, mid-run | `define_ledger` | whenever the company discovers it needs an axis |

The last row is the one that must exist — a company discovers which axes it
needs while it is running, and a declaration that required a release would be
discovered and then not made. The middle two exist because it was the *only*
row, and that made every shipped template start blank on its own subject: a law
firm shipped with five agents, three skills and a workflow graph, and no matter
list, getting one only if some turn thought to invent it. Two runs of one
template then disagreed about what the company even tracks.

### Authoring one

The file is TOML, the filename is the slug, and everything else mirrors the
declaration a `define_ledger` call sends:

```toml
# companies/law_firm/ledgers/matters.toml
title = "Matters"
purpose = "Every matter this firm has open, whose it is, and how each one ended."
written_by = "`record_entry` to open or update a matter, `close_entry` to close one"
checks = ["required-field", "known-status", "closed-needs-reason"]

[[field]]
name = "id"
role = "id"
required = true

[[status]]
name = "open"

[[status]]
name = "closed"
closed = true
needs_reason = true

[[section]]
heading = "Open matters"
statuses = ["open"]
order = "recent"
```

`derived` is deliberately omitted: `derived/<SLUG>.md` is what the author meant,
and naming the folder convention by hand is one more thing to get wrong. A body
`slug` key is accepted only as a cross-check — one that disagrees with the
filename is refused rather than resolved, because either precedence rule ships a
ledger under a slug its author did not write, and every `[[agent]].ledgers` grant
naming the other one then reads as a ledger that does not exist.

Reading is [`company::ledger_file`](../../../src/company/ledger_file.rs), and it
is a *seam*, not a second validator: every file goes through
`LedgerSpec::normalize`, so a bundle ledger and one an agent declares at run time
are held to exactly one set of rules. What the reader adds is what only it can
see — a filename that is not a slug, a slug that shadows a built-in, two files
claiming one derived path, and more declarations than `MAX_DECLARED`.

A company's own bundle is all-or-nothing (shipping a vertical silently short the
axis it is about is the failure this exists to prevent); the baseline is
fault-isolated (one malformed global must not cost the others), which is the same
split `agent_file` already makes for the roster.

### Seeded once, then the company's

Seeding runs at first boot only, and only when the company has declared nothing
at all — see `docs/spec/runtime/globals.md` for why re-applying a baseline on
every boot would undo a retirement, which is a person's call. The built-ins are
never written to the store.

## The agent surface: five tools, however many ledgers

`list_ledgers`, `read_ledger`, `record_entry`, `close_entry`, `define_ledger`.

The count does not grow when a company adds an axis, and that is forced rather
than chosen: the tool schema is built once when the agent is constructed, so a
ledger declared mid-run can get no tool of its own and can appear in no `enum` in
anybody's schema. `ledger` is therefore a plain **string** checked against the
registry at call time, and an unknown slug comes back with the real ones — the
discovery path a model actually follows, in one turn, without having thought to
list them first.

Reads are `ReadOnly`; the three writes are `Write`, so a supervised policy parks
them like any other consequence. There is no delete tool and no retire tool.

The prompt carries a **catalogue** — every ledger named with its purpose — not a
sentence saying `list_ledgers` exists. A tool granted, unmentioned and never
called is the observed failure mode, not a hypothetical one. The catalogue is
built from the registry resolved at agent-build time, so a ledger declared
mid-run is reachable by every tool immediately and named in the *prompt* from the
next build. That is the honest limit: system prompts are assembled once, and
nothing can retroactively edit one already in flight.

### Per-agent visibility and access: `[[agent]].ledgers`

The five tools above are the whole company's surface, uniform across every
agent. `[[agent]].ledgers` narrows that per teammate: a list of
`{ name, access = "read" | "record" }` grants, omitted by default.

An omitted `ledgers` key is **unrestricted** — every ledger, at `record` — the
tool surface every agent had before this field existed, so adding it to a
manifest is a no-op for a company that never opts in. A declared list confines
`list_ledgers`/`read_ledger` to exactly the slugs it names (an undeclared slug
is invisible, not merely unwritable) and requires `access = "record"` for
`record_entry`/`close_entry`; a bare `{ name = "tasks" }` defaults to `read`,
the safer of the two.

This is visibility and read/record — a different axis from
[`writers`](#agents-create-and-record-only-people-delete), which stays the
authoritative check on whether a write actually lands. An `access = "record"`
grant to a built-in ledger whose `writers` excludes that agent is a manifest
validation error, not a disagreement discovered at call time; a
company-declared ledger cannot be checked that early, since it may not exist
yet, so any conflict there is an ordinary tool refusal. `can_declare_ledgers`
(default `true`) gates `define_ledger` alone. See
`docs/spec/runtime/agents.md`.

## Storage

`LedgerStore` (`ports/ledgers.rs`) keeps two things with very different
lifetimes: **declarations** (small, rewritten in place, at most 12) and
**events** (append-only, unbounded). Built-ins are never stored — they ship with
the runtime, and persisting a copy would let a company's stored version drift
from the code every prompt and route is written against.

The store's only ordering obligation is that `events` returns what `append`
appended, in that order. Everything the fold promises rests on that and on
nothing else — in particular not on an event's timestamp, which is written by
whichever replica is running.

All three backends implement it:

| backend | declarations | events |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fs | `ledgers.json` | `ledgers/<slug>.jsonl`, one `write_all` per line under `O_APPEND` |
| sqlite | `ledger_specs` | `ledger_events`, ordered by `AUTOINCREMENT seq` |
| mongodb | `ledger_specs` | `ledger_events`, ordered by a per-company counter |

One event file per ledger rather than one shared log: the fold reads a single
ledger at a time, and a shared file would make every read of the goals scan every
task event ever written.

`delete_spec` leaves the events alone. A ledger nobody reads is worth retiring;
the work recorded in it is not, and deleting a log to tidy a registry is exactly
the loss the append-only shape exists to prevent. Deleting the rows too is
`purge_ledger` — a separate, deliberate act, and a person's.


## The console

The console-facing IA — naming ("ledger" stays an internal word only), how a
company lists reach the sidebar, where declaring and retiring one lives, and
the plain-language wizard — is specified in
[ledgers-console-rendering.md](ledgers-console-rendering.md), split out when
this file outgrew the 500-line cap. The board component, its spec files and
the #/tasks rewrite live there too.
