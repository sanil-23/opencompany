# The console write plane

Every write the operator console makes, under `src/server/ops/`.

Split out of [`api.md`](api.md), which was over the repository's 500-line ceiling.
That file is the map of the API surface; this one is the write routes in detail.

## Console write plane (`src/server/ops/`)

The console's writes are a REST router family under `src/server/ops/`, each
route registered under **both** scope forms (`…/companies/{id}/…` and the
`…/company/…` prosumer alias) by the `scoped` helper. These are the mutations,
plus a deliberate set of **read exceptions** — reads the console must reach over
REST because it ships no GraphQL client: the two inbox `GET`s and the three
workspace `GET`s (tree, file, `search`), the task export
(`GET …/tasks/{taskId}/export`), the skill-registry browse
(`GET …/skills/registry`), the agent detail (`GET …/team/{agentId}`), the policy
read (`GET …/policy`), and the credential status `GET` — every one detailed
below or in the credential section. Every other console read goes through
GraphQL (see the [read plane](api-graphql.md)). Anything a build doesn't serve
`404`s — the console treats that as "not wired yet".

DELETE …/policy                              reset the policy to the manifest's
POST   …/inboxes/{key}/read                  mark inbox messages read

GET    …/inboxes                            list inboxes + unread counts
GET    …/inboxes/{key}/messages              one teammate's mail (store order)
```

The two inbox `GET`s are the read exception, and they are **REST twins of the
`Company.inboxes` GraphQL resolver**: the operator console ships no GraphQL
client, so without them the Inbox view had no reachable per-agent read at all
and fell back to a client-side fixture (issue #173). They read the same
`InboxStore` both inbound paths — the ingest webhook and the IMAP poller — file
into, and `GET …/team` tags each teammate with `inboxEnabled` so the Team toggle
reflects that store too. Messages come back in append order; the console sorts
them newest-first. The GraphQL resolver stays the canonical read for any client
that does speak GraphQL — these routes duplicate it, they do not replace it.

The two original workspace `GET`s (#177) are the same story one issue later:
the console had no reachable workspace read either, so the Workspace tab
persisted to `localStorage` and the operator and the agents looked at two
different trees —
a note written by an agent through its `workspace_*` tools (#237) was invisible
to the operator, and vice versa. They are REST twins of `Company.workspaceTree`
/ `workspaceFile`, differing only in timestamp shape (epoch millis, matching
every other console read, rather than ISO-8601 strings). The backlink scan is
literally shared code (`company::workspace_links`), so the two surfaces cannot
report different backlinks for the same note. The tree read carries metadata
only — bodies are fetched per file, so a navigation read does not grow with the
size of the workspace. Reading a folder id as a file is a `404`, never an empty
note.

`GET …/workspace/search?q=…` (#607) is the **third workspace read**: it answers
which notes mention a phrase, so discovery costs one call rather than a listing
plus one read per candidate.
Matching is a plain **case-insensitive substring** over node names and text
bodies — no tokenising, no stemming, no ranking — which is the only definition
that answers identically on all three storage backends, and it is defined once
in `company::workspace_search`, shared with the GraphQL `Company.workspaceSearch`
resolver and the agent `workspace_search` tool. Optional `prefix` scopes to a
subtree; optional `limit` pages the answer (default 20, hard cap 50). A hit
carries the node, its logical `path`, whether the `name` or the `content`
matched, and — for a content match — a short `excerpt`. `total` reports every
match, so a capped page says it is one. An empty `q` is a `400`, not "match
everything": that is the tree read above, and answering it here would turn a
cleared search box into a full-tree fetch. `limit=0` is a `400` for the same
reason — it is never read as "no limit". A **binary** node matches on its name
only: a text read of a payload is empty by the port's definition, and its bytes
are never scanned or excerpted.

`POST …/workspace/sweep-empty-agent-folders` (#700) removes the empty
`agents/<id>/` folders a pre-#570 company still carries. Operator-triggered
rather than automatic — the affected tenants are hosted, so a subcommand would
be unreachable for the operators who need it, and a boot sweep would change a
tree on an upgrade nobody asked for. `?dry_run=true` answers
`{"wouldRemove":[{id,name}…]}` and touches nothing, so the console can name
every folder on a confirm dialog; the real call answers `{"removed":[…]}`, and
which field carries the list is what actually happened. A node qualifies only
when it is a direct child of the `agents` root **by id**, is a folder, and has
**no children counted structurally** — over every node in the tree, before any
path is rendered, because a folder whose only child carries a path separator
reads as empty to anything path-shaped while the recursive delete would still
take it (#671), and sqlite and mongodb both accept such a name. An ambiguous
root is a `409`, not a guess. Each removal announces its own
`WorkspaceChanged{removed}` (#327); a second run removes nothing.

`POST …/workspace/merge-duplicate-folders` (#759) repairs a tree a publish race
already broke. Two concurrent first publishes of one deliverable can each create
the folder they both read as missing; from then on every publish beneath that
path is refused as ambiguous, for every agent, until somebody edits the tree.
Stopping new races does nothing for a tenant already in that state, and on a
hosted tenant this route is the only way out of it — operator-triggered, never
automatic, for the reason the sweep above is.

A duplicate set is two or more sibling **folders** sharing a name, matched by
`parent_id` and never by rendered path. The oldest by `updated_at_millis` wins,
with the node id breaking a tie so a preview and the confirm behind it cannot
disagree. The losers' children are `rename_move`d into the winner — ids
preserved, so an artifact recorded against a published node still resolves —
and a folder-folder collision among those children becomes another merge in the
same run, iterating to a fixpoint. Nothing is renamed, nothing is overwritten,
and a loser is deleted only once it is **structurally empty in a fresh read**
taken after the relocations, so a publish landing mid-merge leaves its folder
standing rather than losing anything (#671 / #700 discipline).

Any collision involving a **file** is refused and reported: two files at one
path are two documents, and every rule for picking one discards somebody's work.
`?dry_run=true` answers `{"wouldMerge":[{id,name,intoId,moved:[{id,name}…],
removed}…],"residuals":[…]}` and touches nothing; the real call answers
`{"merged":[…],"residuals":[…]}`, and which field carries the folds is what
actually happened. `residuals` is on **both**, always — each entry is
`{id,name,parentId?,cause}` with `cause` one of `fileSharesTheName` (a note
shares the duplicated name, so the whole group was left alone), `fileInTheWay`
(the winner already holds a note of that name), or `treeMovedOn` (the store
refused the move because the tree changed; run it again). It is the half of the
answer that says whether the tree is actually repaired. Moves and deletes
announce `WorkspaceChanged` (#327); a second run with nothing left to do changes
nothing.

All three workspace `GET`s — tree, file and `search` — and the `POST` / `PATCH`
node bodies carry `createdBy` and `updatedBy` (#326), each
`{"kind":"seed"|"operator"|"agent",
"id"?}` with `id` present exactly when `kind` is `agent`. `createdBy` is fixed
at creation; `updatedBy` follows content writes only, so an operator rename does
not repaint an agent's authorship. The console renders the creator as a badge
and the last writer only when the two differ. Both fields are always serialized,
and a node predating the field reads back as `operator`. The `PUT` write route
stamps `operator`; agent writes stamp `agent{id}` from the agent's roster id,
which is fixed at agent-build time and never taken from tool arguments. Agents
reach the same tree through `workspace_list` / `workspace_search` /
`workspace_read` / `workspace_create` / `workspace_write`, and a created note has its default home
in the reserved `agents/<agent-id>/` folder (#551) — a convention the persona
brief steers toward, not a boundary the routes enforce. `workspace_rename` and
`workspace_delete` (#671) are the exception: those two *are* bounded to
`agents/<agent-id>/`, checked on the resolved node so an `id` argument refuses
exactly as its path would. Neither restamps authorship; a delete leaves any
artifact version that pointed at the node with a dangling `workspaceNodeId`,
which is the same state the `DELETE` route above produces and is read-guarded
before reuse. Boot scaffolds the
`agents/` root empty; an individual `agents/<agent-id>/` is minted the first
time that agent writes into it, and the `desks/` root is minted whole the first
time a desk produces something (#645) — so a tree read on a fresh company shows
exactly one root and no member folders.

Team writes are an **operator overlay** persisted through the store, merged
into the manifest roster at read time — the version-controlled `company.toml`
is never rewritten. Overlay teammates are addressable: since issue #71 the
harness builds a real agent for each one, with the company-wide tool grant, no
cognition tier, and never the orchestrator.

`POST …/team` and the orchestrator's `add_agent` tool both **derive the roster
id from the display name** (issue #686): "Dana Designer" becomes
`dana_designer`, in the same snake_case grammar the manifest validator enforces
on a hand-authored `[[agent]].id`. They used to mint an opaque
`{millis}-{counter}` id, which #570/#552/#607 render as a workspace folder and
in search-hit paths — so half a company's tree read as
`agents/019fad5ada20-000000000003/` beside `agents/backend_engineer/`.

- **Collisions suffix, they do not refuse.** A slug already held by a manifest
  agent, another teammate, a desk id or name, or a reserved word (`operator`,
  `agents`, `desks`) becomes `<slug>_2`, `_3`, … Duplicate display names have
  always been accepted here, and an unsuffixed collision with a *manifest* id is
  worse than a refusal: the roster build skips it, so the teammate would persist
  and never materialise.
- **Minted once, never re-minted.** `PATCH …/team/{agentId}` renames a teammate
  and leaves the id alone; a name-keyed id would orphan its workspace folder,
  budget row, desk memberships and inbox on every correction.
- **Removal frees the slug**, so re-adding the same name takes the id back and
  **adopts the old `agents/<slug>/` folder** — the intended remedy for a typo'd
  name, and not a way to get a clean slate.

Teammates carrying generated ids are **not migrated**: rewriting them would
rewrite the `WorkspaceOrigin` stamps issue #326 keeps honest, and every path
into their folders. They keep working, reachable by display name through
`crate::runtime::assignee`.

`GET …/team/{agentId}` is the **agent detail** read (issue #264). `GET …/team`
answers "who is on the roster"; this answers "what is this agent", and before it
existed neither the console nor any other client could reach an agent's tier,
its tool grants or its desk membership — the roster row carried none of them, so
checking what a company actually grants an agent was not possible from outside
the process.

The `tools` object is the reason the route earns its keep. It carries four
lists, because only the last is the answer:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `requested` | the agent's own `tools` globs. **Empty means the company's standard grant**, not "no tools" |
| `companyAllow` | the `[tools].allow` ceiling |
| `deskAllow` | the union of the `tools` ceilings of the desks this agent sits on, already narrowed by `companyAllow`. **Empty means the narrowed ceiling grants nothing** — which is *not* "no desk narrows anything"; `deskCeilingActive` tells those apart |
| `deskCeilingActive` | whether any desk this agent sits on states a `tools` ceiling. Distinct from `deskAllow`, which can resolve to an empty list while a ceiling is still in play — a console keying on `deskAllow`'s emptiness would substitute `companyAllow` and promise grants the host drops |
| `effective` | what the agent actually holds, after all three levels |

The three ceilings shrink monotonically, so a console can render them as a
chain. Both "empty" readings above are the same trap in two places: an empty
grant list means *inherit*, never *nothing*, and a surface rendering it as "no
tools" has inverted the meaning.

`effective` is computed by the same `agent_scoped_grants` the harness calls when
it builds the agent, so the readout cannot drift from what is enforced. The
constructor takes the company record and agent id rather than a pre-extracted
allow-list, because the desk level cannot be derived from the company grant
alone — that shape is what makes "forgot to apply the desk ceiling"
unrepresentable at a call site rather than something three callers each have to
remember.

`GET …/tools/catalog` is the companion read: every grantable thing this company
has — built-in families, `[[mcp_server]]` entries, `[tools.composio]` toolkits —
in one vocabulary, each row carrying the exact grant token an operator would
write. See [runtime/tools.md](tools.md).
`isOrchestrator` is likewise resolved by the roster rule (a `tier =
"orchestrator"` agent, else the first declared) rather than read off `tier`, so
a company that tags nobody still names its orchestrator.

`global` marks the teammates the [global baseline](globals.md) merged in — the
ones every company has whichever vertical it started from. It is sent on every
row because a client
cannot otherwise tell a company somebody staffed from one nobody has: the
baseline is on every roster, so `length === 0` is a question with one answer.
The console's first-run gate turns on it
([company-setup.md](company-setup.md)); before the field existed that gate could
never open.

`PATCH …/team/{agentId}` edits a teammate's `name`, `role`, `description` and
`tools`. It is a patch: an omitted key is left alone, and `"description": null`
clears it — the two must stay apart or every partial save would erase an agent's
instructions. A blank `name`/`role` is `400` and an unknown teammate `404`.

A **manifest** teammate is edited here too, and this is the one thing the route
does differently: instead of rewriting `company.toml`, the host stores the change
as an `overlay_agent_edits` entry on the company record and resolves it through
`CompanyRecord::effective_agent`, the same call `build_roster` makes. So the
blueprint keeps stating what the company launched with, the overlay states what
the operator has since decided, and the console card and the running teammate
cannot disagree. The merge is per field, so a field nobody edited still tracks
the blueprint across a rebuild. This is what makes a *deployed* company's roster
— including the global-baseline agents every company gets — changeable at all: a
hosted tenant has no `company.toml` to edit and no redeploy to make. The edit
reaches the next turn rather than the next restart, because it moves the pool's
overlay fingerprint (`overlay_fingerprint`, see
[ports-state.md](ports-state.md)).

Every detail response carries an `editable` list naming the fields this route
will accept, so a client renders read-only from the host's answer instead of
re-deriving the rule. `tools` is admin-only for both kinds — an empty list means
"the company's standard grant", so a `tools` edit is a potential *widening* —
and `tier` is read-only for both: it has no override layer, and adding one is a
policy decision rather than a form field.

`DELETE …/team/{agentId}` removes a teammate. An overlay teammate is deleted
outright — the record is the only thing that declares it. A **manifest**
teammate is removed by recording a tombstone in `overlay_retired_agents`, for
the reason an edit is an overlay: `company.toml` and the baseline merged into it
are re-read on every rebuild, so a teammate deleted by rewriting the roster
would simply come back. `CompanyRecord::effective_agents` filters the tombstoned
ids out, which is what takes the teammate off the roster, off its desks, out of
the delegation targets and out of the harness build — rather than merely off the
Team page. If it was the orchestrator, the role moves to the next teammate that
is actually there.

Either way the teammate's operator-added desk seats, its edit overlay and its
budget override go with it; a blueprint desk seat is left in the manifest and
filtered at read time. The **one refusal** is the company's last teammate
(`409`): an empty roster has no orchestrator, nobody to answer a message and no
way back from the console.

The two **budget** routes (issue #343) are how a teammate's `budget_usd_daily`
becomes changeable without a redeploy. Both are **admin-only** — a member gets
`403` and an unauthenticated caller `401` — and both stamp who set the cap and
when, surfaced as `budgetSetBy` / `budgetSetAtMillis` on the roster row. A
stored cap wins over the manifest, and the change is enforced on the teammate's
**next dispatch**: the harness fingerprints the override set alongside its other
freshness axes, so the roster is rebuilt before the next turn rather than at the
next process start.

`PUT` takes `{"budgetUsdDaily": <number|null>}` and the three cases stay apart
on the wire, which is the point of the route:

| body | effect |
|---|---|
| `{"budgetUsdDaily": 5}` | cap at $5/day |
| `{"budgetUsdDaily": 0}` | cap at nothing — a real cap, not "uncapped" |
| `{"budgetUsdDaily": null}` | remove the cap, beating a manifest cap |
| `{}` | **`422`** — an omitted key is never read as "remove the cap" |

A negative or non-finite amount is `400`; an unknown teammate is `404`.
`DELETE` drops the override so the manifest default applies again — distinct
from `PUT null`, and not expressible by it. `POST …/team` also accepts an
optional `budgetUsdDaily`, so a console-created teammate can be given a cap at
creation; only that form of the add requires an admin.

The three **policy** routes (issue #562) are the company-scoped twin of the
budget pair. Before them the autonomy tier lived only in `[policy].mode` and
nothing in the console read or wrote it, so an operator drowning in approval
cards could change it only by redeploying an edited `company.toml` — or, on a
hosted tenant with a read-only manifest snapshot, not at all.

`GET` returns the tier and always-ask list **in force**, what the manifest would
restore, whether an override is set and by whom, and the selectable tiers with
the host's own description of each (`POLICY_MODES` narrowed to tiers the console
has text for, so it never offers one the host would downgrade). `PUT` takes `mode`
and `alwaysApprove`, both optional and independent — `{"mode": "auto"}`
leaves the list alone, `{"alwaysApprove": []}` clears it (a real state, not a
reset), `{"mode": null}` stops overriding the tier, and `{}` is a **`422`**
because a body that sets nothing is never stored. An unknown `mode` is `422`
too, not accepted-and-downgraded, or the console would show a tier the gate was
not running. Both writes are admin-only and attributed. `DELETE` restores the
manifest's `[policy]` — its own verb, since a `PUT` of the manifest's current
values would pin them. The change takes effect on the company's **next turn**
(`ApprovalPolicy` is built per roster build, and this override is fingerprinted
alongside the other freshness axes). It survives a rebuild unless the seed's
`[policy]` itself changed: version control wins when it speaks, so tightening
`company.toml` clears a looser tier set here, and a redeploy that changed
nothing does not.

### Credential-bearing surfaces (feature-gated)

These write secrets to the `SecretStore` and expose only non-secret status.
The native OAuth compatibility routes below deliberately **do not** write a
credential: the old credential was unreachable by agents.

```text
GET    …/credential                         whether the company has its own key + which tier it presents
PUT    …/credential                         set / rotate / clear the company's TinyHumans key  [admin]
GET    …/domain                             the stored domain + records + last verify result, or `null`
PUT    …/domain                             set the custom domain  [admin]
POST   …/domain/verify                       server-side DNS check
GET    …/smtp                               non-secret SMTP status (`configured: false` when unset)
PUT    …/smtp                               store SMTP credentials (secret store)  [admin]
POST   …/smtp/test                           send a test email  [admin]
POST   …/connections/{provider}/start        retired native OAuth bridge → 410 JSON until 2026-09-30  [feature: oauth]
POST   …/connections/{provider}/disconnect   drop a legacy stored OAuth token  [feature: oauth]
GET    /api/v1/oauth/callback                retired browser landing page → 410 HTML until 2026-09-30  [feature: oauth]
```

The two `GET`s are the REST siblings of the GraphQL `Company.domain` /
`Company.smtp` reads and share their loaders, so the planes cannot disagree
about the fields they both carry. They can still differ in *detail*: REST
answers the full `DomainStatus` and `SmtpStatus`, while `DomainStatusGql` omits
the per-record `checks` from the last verify pass and `SmtpStatusGql` omits
`security`, `from_name` and `from_email`. Both are open to any member (the
`[admin]` line guards the company's outward identity, not the reading of it) and
neither carries credential material: the SMTP password is absent from
`SmtpStatus` by construction.

`PUT …/smtp` treats the password as a **patch** — a body that omits it keeps the
stored one, so a form can offer "stored — leave blank to keep" instead of
charging a credential re-entry for a from-name fix. A body carrying one behaves
exactly as before, and one that supplies neither with nothing stored is `400`.
A supplied password is stored **byte for byte** — leading and trailing
whitespace is preserved, because it can be significant to the remote server.
Trimming decides only *whether* one was supplied: a value that is empty or
entirely whitespace counts as omitted and keeps the stored password, so an
all-whitespace password cannot be set through this route. Any value with a
non-whitespace character in it is stored exactly as sent.

Keeping the stored password costs no read-modify-write. The configuration and
the password live under separate secret keys, so a passwordless save rewrites
the configuration and never touches the secret — a rotation arriving at the same
moment survives instead of being reverted, however many processes are writing.

Credentials written before that split still carry the password inside the
configuration blob; reads fall back to it, and the first passwordless save after
the split migrates it to its own key. That migration is the one path that must
read and then write, so `PUT …/smtp` serializes per company for the duration of
the handler. The lock is in-process, which covers the deployed topology (a
tenant is a single container); two replicas of one company would reopen the
window on the legacy path alone, and closing it there would need a conditional
write that `SecretStore` cannot express today.

`…/credential` is the company's **one** TinyHumans key, presented by every
surface wired to it (**Composio today**) — see
[`credentials.md`](credentials.md) for the resolution order, the rotation
guarantee, and which surfaces are deliberately outside it.

### Retired native OAuth callback

`/api/v1/oauth/callback` stays reachable for a browser that began consent
immediately before a deploy. It returns a non-caching `410 Gone` HTML page that
says the authorization was not saved, why native OAuth cannot make agents able
to use the provider, and to use Composio instead. It ignores the provider's
`code` and `state` rather than exchanging or storing them.

`POST …/connections/{provider}/start` is likewise a `410 Gone` JSON response
with stable code `native_oauth_retired`, an explanatory message, and
`removalAfter: "2026-09-30"`. Both temporary endpoints send `Deprecation:
true` and a `Sunset: Wed, 30 Sep 2026 00:00:00 GMT` header. #1023 removes the
bridge after the cache compatibility window established by #979; it keeps
Disconnect and the read projection so tenants can release credentials written
before #828.
