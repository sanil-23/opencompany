# Checkpoints and Approvals

The trust core of the product: agents act freely inside the fence; anything
irreversible waits for the Operator. This doc is normative.

## Checkpoint taxonomy

Effect kinds that MAY require sign-off, grouped by what they risk:

| Group | Effect kinds (examples) | Default in `supervised` mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spend** | `payment.send`, `subscription.start`, x402 outbound above cap | approval above `auto_approve_under_usd` |
| **Send** | `email.send`, `dm.external`, any first message to a new counterparty | approval for new counterparties; allowed for established threads |
| **Sign** | `filing.submit`, `contract.accept` | always approval |
| **Publish** | `external.publish`, Agent Card / price changes, website deploys | always approval |
| **Hire** | outbound A2A engagement with a new company; firing a vendor | approval above threshold or first-time counterparty |
| **Identity** | handle registration/renewal, key rotation, delegated signer mint/expand | always approval |

`readonly` mode gates *every* effect; `full` mode auto-allows everything
except `[policy].always_approve` entries. `auto` sits between `supervised` and
`full`: the agent's own sandbox writes and its outward reads run unattended,
and anything that leaves the company or spends on submit still parks — see
[the tier line](grants.md#the-auto-tier).

Three of the four names are OpenHuman's own security tiers. `auto` is not, so
the mapping is no longer 1:1 and `PolicyMode::security_tier()` — the accessor
that asserted it was — has been deleted rather than made to lie. Where the two
vocabularies still have to meet, `harness::toolbelt::autonomy_for` borrows
`Supervised` for `auto`; the argument is on that function and matters, because
a workflow `tool_call` node has no `ApprovalPolicy` above it.

## Approval lifecycle

```text
effect emitted ─▶ evaluate ─▶ Allow ─▶ execute, journal
                      │
                      ├─▶ Deny ─▶ returned to brain as refusal (it replans)
                      │
                      └─▶ RequireApproval ─▶ park (ApprovalId)
                                              │  surfaces in approvals inbox + chat
                                              ▼
                            operator resolves: approve │ deny │ edit
                                              │
                                              ▼
                            ApprovalResolved event ─▶ follow-up cycle
```

- **Default-deny on silence**: parked approvals expire (default 7 days,
  configurable) to `deny`. Nothing irreversible ever happens because the
  Operator was on vacation.
- **Edit** lets the Operator amend the effect payload (fix the email, lower
  the amount) and approve the amended version; the brain sees both the
  original and the edit.
- Resolution requires operator auth ([runtime/api.md](../runtime/api.md));
  the resolving `Actor` is journaled.
- Approve executes the parked effect exactly once
  (journal-before-execute, [runtime/lifecycle.md](../runtime/lifecycle.md));
  deny feeds the refusal back so the brain replans rather than retries.
- **Resolution is idempotent.** Resolving an approval that is no longer parked
  — a double-submit, a retried request, two operators on the same queue —
  is a no-op with a fixed reply. It writes no journal record and runs no
  follow-up cycle.

## Emergency stop (the governance kill switch)

`POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/emergency-pause` denies **every** new effect
outside the `Other` group, ahead of every policy rule including
`always_approve`. `POST .../emergency-resume` releases it. Both are
owner-scoped and both take a confirmation phrase in the body. Normative:

- **It denies, it does not park.** Parking would make the approval queue an
  escape hatch from the switch: an operator could approve the very effects they
  just stopped without ever releasing it. Denial returns to the brain as a
  refusal it replans around, which is what "park all new work" has to mean.
- **`Other` stays allowed, so chat survives.** The operator has to be able to
  ask the company what it was doing. Effects classified as `Other` remain
  allowed while the emergency stop is engaged; the gate otherwise treats
  `Other` as a catch-all group, not a chat-only one, and does not police which
  tools it covers.
- **It is orthogonal to `lifecycle`.** `lifecycle = "paused"` rejects every
  request with a `409`, chat included — the opposite of what an emergency
  needs. A company can be `running` *and* stopped; resuming one does not resume
  the other. `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}` reports `emergency_paused`
  separately, and a console that reads only `lifecycle` will show a stopped
  company as healthy.
- **Already-parked approvals stay resolvable.** The switch gates `evaluate`,
  which runs before an effect executes; resolution does not pass through it.
  New work stops, in-flight decisions the operator was already asked for do
  not become unanswerable.
- **The event log is the durable state.** The last
  `CompanyEvent::EmergencyPauseChanged` decides, replayed at boot, so a stop
  survives a restart. There is deliberately no `CompanyRecord` field: a second
  copy of a safety flag is a second thing that can disagree with the first.
- **Fails safe.** If the log cannot be read at boot, the company comes up
  **stopped**. A company wrongly stopped is a visible, one-request problem; a
  company wrongly running is the failure the switch exists to prevent, and
  nothing would surface it.
- **Engaging is eager, releasing is durable-first.** Engaging flips the
  in-memory flag before journaling, so enforcement never waits on I/O that can
  fail. Releasing journals first and only clears the flag on success, so a
  failed write leaves the company stopped. The unsafe direction is never taken
  on a best-effort basis.
- **No timeout, ever.** Unlike a parked approval, the stop does not expire and
  is untouched by the TTL sweep. Only a deliberate `emergency-resume` by an
  identified operator clears it. A kill switch that lets itself go would resume
  work at 3am with nobody watching.
- **Both transitions are journaled with the acting `Actor`** and an optional
  operator note.

Confirmation is asymmetric on purpose: engaging takes the fixed phrase
`EMERGENCY-PAUSE` (an operator reaching for a panic button should not have to
look up an id), while releasing takes **the company's own id**, so the only way
out of the stop cannot be reached by replaying one body across companies.

Credential revocation — the other half of the audit's "emergency pause and
credential revocation" — is not covered here; it needs token scoping in the
harness.

### Settling the verdict is not running the follow-up

Resolving is two halves with very different durations, and the runtime keeps
them apart:

1. **Settle** — record the verdict, journal it, mint the grant (or execute the
   native effect). Milliseconds. When it returns, the operator's decision is
   permanent.
2. **Follow-up cycle** — a full agent turn, so the brain learns the verdict and
   re-issues the granted call. Can take minutes.

The follow-up always runs on its **own task**, which the resolve then awaits.
That makes it drop-safe: a client that disappears mid-turn — a closed tab, or a
reverse proxy giving up on a slow upstream — abandons the *waiting*, not the
work. Fused, the two halves meant a dropped connection cancelled the
re-dispatch after the grant had already been spent, so the operator's approval
bought nothing and the conversation never resumed.

A resolve can also **detach** (`"detach": true`), answering the moment the
verdict is durable rather than holding the response open for the turn. The
continuation then arrives on the event stream's `agent_reply` frame. The
blocking form remains the default and its response body is unchanged.

A follow-up cycle that *fails* is logged host-side and leaves a recoverable
state, never a stranded one: the verdict and grant are already durable, and
re-approving is the idempotent no-op above, so a retry mints no second grant.

## Approving a blocked tool call: single-use grants

Moved to [`grants.md`](grants.md) — this file was over the repository's 500-line limit. See that page for the full detail. What moved, in the order it appears there:

- single-use grants: what approving a blocked **tool** call mints, versus a **native** effect the runtime performs itself (approving one of those executes it, per the lifecycle above);
- [standing grants](grants.md#standing-grants-this-tool-for-this-teammate-until-a-deadline) — this tool, for this teammate, until a deadline — and [what can never be granted broadly](grants.md#what-can-never-be-granted-broadly);
- [the `auto` tier](grants.md#the-auto-tier) that low-consequence middle defines, and [listing and revoking](grants.md#listing-and-revoking) live standing grants;
- [which tier a new company gets](grants.md#which-tier-a-new-company-gets) (issue #605);
- [what an `always_approve` entry names](grants.md#what-an-always_approve-entry-names-issue-684) (issue #684);
- [precedence at the tool gate](grants.md#precedence-at-the-tool-gate), and its step 7, [per-call judgement](grants.md#per-call-judgement-issue-338) (issue #338).

## Approvals inside a workflow run (issue #395)

A workflow run is not a cycle, and for a long time that meant nothing a run
parked ever reached this queue. Two distinct holes, both now closed.

**A gated tool call inside an `agent` node.** The node's turn runs on the same
pool and the same `ApprovalPolicy` as chat, so a blocked call *was* recorded on
the shared request queue — but the only drain lived inside `run_cycle` behind a
`CycleHost`, which the workflow path never reaches. The request sat there until
the next chat cycle cleared the queue, and the operator was never asked. The
node now takes a queue boundary before its turn, claims only the tail its own
turn added, and parks each entry. Approving one is the ordinary single-use grant
above: the workflow has already finished with the refusal narrated, so the
approved call **runs standalone** and does not feed downstream nodes.

**A node marked `requires_approval`.** The engine reports these as node ids on
the run outcome, which reached the HTTP response and the `WorkflowRunFinished`
line — neither of which is an approval. Each pending gate now parks a
`workflow.approve` effect carrying the workflow id, the node id and the trigger
input, deduped on that triple so a re-run does not stack a second card for one
decision. It is a **native** effect (no `agent`), so approving performs it
rather than minting a grant.

### Approving a paused gate re-runs the workflow

The engine **settles** a paused run — nothing holds a task, a connection or a
continuation. So there is nothing to resume, and "continue" necessarily means
starting a fresh supervised run with the approved gate id unioned into the
trigger input's `approvals` array. The parked effect carries everything that
needs, which is what makes it survive a restart: journal replay rehydrates the
card and approving it still continues the work.

The cost is stated rather than hidden: **upstream nodes re-execute**. Agent
nodes re-spend tokens, and a reached `output` node **re-delivers** — a
warm-recipient email sends again, because the established-thread check is
state-based, not run-based. A gate normally sits *before* the side-effecting
node it guards, which is the entire reason to author one, so this is acceptable
for now; it is a real constraint on where a gate belongs in a graph.

A gate nobody decides ages out on the ordinary TTL to a default deny. Since the
paused run settled long ago, that costs nothing and cancels nothing.

## Where the request is raised (issue #379)

An approval is not only a queue entry; it is an interruption of a conversation.
So a park records **which conversation** — `ApprovalParked.thread`, stamped by
the cycle from its own trigger events, surfaced on `ApprovalSummary.thread`, and
carried onto `GrantedCall.origin_thread` when the approval mints a grant.

The id is `OperatorMessage.chat`: a desk id for a channel, a roster agent id for
a direct message. `Effect.agent` cannot stand in for it, and that is the whole
reason the field exists — a desk channel and a direct message to that desk's
lead are answered by the same teammate, so a request placed by asker would be
raised inside the wrong one of the two.

It follows the work rather than the queue entry. A resolution inherits the
thread of the approval it settles, so a follow-up turn that needs a **second**
sign-off re-parks in the channel the first was asked in instead of falling out
of the conversation. And the redeemed grant's continuation is journaled into
that thread too — approving something visibly causes the next thing to happen,
in the place the operator was already reading.

The stamp is refused rather than guessed. A cycle batching two conversations,
or an addressed turn beside an unaddressed one, or beside a task dispatch,
stamps nothing. An approval with no thread — a workflow delivery, a scheduler
tick, anything parked before this shipped — belongs to no conversation and is
shown on the Approvals page alone, which is where every approval was shown
before. The page always lists everything; the in-conversation card is additive.

The event log carries the park itself (`CompanyEvent::ApprovalParked`) so the
card can appear live. It is deliberately thin — an id, a dotted kind, a thread —
because the effect's payload is redacted in exactly one place and must not
acquire a second. A reader re-reads the approvals feed for the rest.

### One turn is asked about once (issue #842)

A research turn that reaches `espn.com`, `bbc.com` and `theguardian.com` parks
three approvals, and asking three times is the same fact told badly: it is one
piece of work, and every interruption costs a re-dispatch cycle that can
dead-end. So the parks a single turn raised are **surfaced as one request**.

The grouping key is not new. Issue #469 already journals the parking cycle, so
that a turn blocked on four decisions is continued exactly once when the last
one lands. `ApprovalSummary.batch` projects that same key, which is what makes
the two agree by construction: the batch an operator is asked about in one card
is precisely the batch the runtime holds a single continuation for. It is opaque
— an equality key, never an ordering, a count, or anything to show an operator.

**The grant model does not change at all.** There is no batch entity on the
host, no batch resolve on the wire, and nothing new in how a grant is minted,
stored or revoked. Each approval keeps its own id, its own verdict and — on
approve — its own host-scoped grant, so approving three fetches still leaves
three independently revocable rows under `Standing permissions`, one per host,
each with its own expiry. Batching the *asking* is not batching the *granting*,
and widening a grant to save a click would be exactly the leak `grants.md`
exists to prevent.

Two renderings over that one state, divided by what each surface is **for**:

- **Chat is the fast path: all-or-nothing.** One card per turn, listing the
  hosts it covers, with a single Approve/Decline and the ordinary scope
  control. Approve grants every call in the batch; Decline grants none. The
  operator is mid-conversation and wants one decision, not a form. It answers
  every item it is still asking about, because the turn stays blocked until each
  parked call has a verdict — a decision that left one open would hold the turn
  while looking as though it had resolved the card.
- **The Approvals page is the granular path: itemised.** One row per gated
  call, approved or declined on its own, matching how `Standing permissions`
  lists one revocable row per grant. It is where an operator goes for precision,
  or to clean up after the fact. A row says how many others came from the same
  turn, so someone arriving from the toast can tell one batch from an unrelated
  queue.

Granular control in *both* places would be redundant, and would double the state
that has to stay in step between two surfaces — so it lives in one.

**A decision that does not land is named, not swallowed.** One click fans out to
one resolve per item, so a failure on the third leaves two effects authorised
and one not. A toast is the wrong home for that — it does not say *which*, and
it is gone by the time the operator looks back at the card — so the row that
failed says so itself, the card counts the failures honestly (never "nothing was
recorded" about a click that authorised two of three), and the buttons stay live,
because a retry is the way out. A retry re-resolves only what is still pending.

The two must not drift, and do not, because neither owns any state: both render
the same feed, and both react to the `approval_resolved` frame. Deciding a row
on the page settles that item on the chat card without a reload, and the card
reports a partial state (`1 of 3 decided`) rather than going on claiming three
things are pending.

An approval with **no** batch — a workflow node, a scheduler tick, a park
journaled before #469 — is never grouped, not even with another one like it.
Absent means "the host did not say which turn this came from", and folding two
unknowns together would invent a batch out of a shared silence. Each is shown
alone, exactly as before this existed.

### What the confirmation may claim (issue #561)

Approving does not start work in every case, so the sentence an operator gets
back must say which case they are in. There are two, and the console can tell
them apart from the same `batch` key:

- **Released** — this was the last sign-off the turn was blocked on, so the host
  runs the continuation now. The agent has been asked to pick the work back up.
- **Still waiting** — the turn parked other calls and at least one is undecided,
  so the host banks the verdict and runs nothing (`still_waiting_report`). The
  confirmation must not claim anything is under way, and must say what is still
  outstanding, because deciding the rest is the operator's way out.

The console counts the second case itself rather than waiting for a wire field:
`/approvals` answers with exactly the undecided parks, so the rows sharing this
one's `batch` *are* the outstanding set. All three surfaces route through
`approvedContinuation` in `frontend/src/lib/language.ts`; only the Approvals page
produces a non-zero count, because the chat card decides every call its turn
parked in one click and so releases by construction.

Even the released half stops at "asked for". A continuation queues behind the
per-company serial lock for an unbounded time (issue #390) and the console
cannot see that wait, so the sentence names the recovery — send the agent a
message — rather than promising an outcome it does not control. Before this,
every approve answered *"the agent is completing the action"*, which was
measured on staging claiming completion over four minutes in which the step trace
still read `Awaiting approval · didn't run`.

This is the console half only. The turn still dead-ends and approval still costs
a re-dispatch; that mechanism is the open headline of #561 and lives in
openhuman's turn loop, not here.

## Delegation levels (standing rules)

Prosumers adjust the fence in plain language, which compiles to policy:

- "Auto-approve spending under $5" → `auto_approve_under_usd = 5.0`
- "Never contact my customers directly" → `never_do` → `Deny` on
  `dm.external` matching the customer list
- "You can post to the blog without asking" → remove `publish_artifact` from
  `always_approve` for that channel. Nothing to remove unless the operator put
  it there: `always_approve` defaults to empty, and under `supervised` it is
  the checkpoint taxonomy — not the list — that parks a publish

Standing-rule changes are themselves Charter edits with provenance and audit
([charter.md](charter.md)); loosening a rule takes effect for *future*
effects only.

## Audit

The approval log is immutable: every evaluate decision, park, resolution
(with actor and timestamp), expiry, and execution outcome is an `EventLog`
entry, and money-touching effects additionally journal to the ledger. The
operator surface renders this as plain history ("you approved sending the
Acme invoice on June 2").
